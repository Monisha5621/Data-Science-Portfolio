ors kamal mohan gupta n madhusoodhanan and sathish for the appearing parties the judgment of the court was delivered by dalveer bhandari 1 this petition has been filed in public interest under article 32 of the constitution in the wake 8 of serious violations and abuse of children who are forcefully detained in circuses in many instances without any access to their families under extreme inhuman conditions there are instances of sexual abuse on daily basis physical abuse as well as emotional abuse the children are deprived of basic human needs of food and water 2 it is stated in the petition that the petitioner has filed this petition following series of incidents where the petitioner came in contact with many children who were trafficked into performing in circuses the petitioner found that circus is one of the ancient forms of indigenous entertainment in the world with humans having major role to play however the activities that are undertaken in these circuses deprive the artists especially children of their basic fundamental rights most of them are trafficked from some poverty stricken areas of nepal as well as from backward districts of india the outside world has no meaning for them there is no life beyond the circus campus once they enter irito the circuses they are confined to the circus arena with no freedom of mobility and choice they are entrapped into the world of circuses for the rest of their lives leading vagrant tunnelled existence away from the hub of society which is tiresome claustrophobic and dependent on vicissitudes 3 it is submitted that the petitioner is engaged in social movement for the emancipation of children in exploitative labour bondage and servitude bachpan bachao andolan has been able to liberate thousands of children with the help of the judiciary and the executive as well as through persuasion social mobilization and education 358 supreme court repoi ts 2011 5 c a 4 it is submitted that for the first time the petitioner came to know about the plight of children in indian circuses way back in 1996 at that time the petitioner had rescued 18 girls from circus performing in vidisha district of madhya pradesh this was possible after complaint made by 12 year old girl who managed to escape from the circus premises her complaint was that she and several other nepalese girls had been trafficked and forced to stay and perform in the circus where they were being sexually abused and were kept in most inhuman conditions d 5 following this incident an organised attempt was made by the petitioner to understand and learn more about the problem of child labour in indian circuses and how to eradicate the same this began in july 2002 with the initiation of research on the problem of child labour in indian circuses the findings in the abovementioned research were compiled in report termed eliminating child labour from indian circuses 6 once all the above facts and figures were established the petitioner decided to implement multi pronged strategy to eradicate the practice of employing children in indian circuses simultaneously preparations were made to put across the problem in front of circus owners to make them aware of the moral and legal questions pertaining to the use of children in circuses the petitioner initiated dialogue with all the major circus owners and appealed to them to stop trafficking bondage child labour and other violations of child rights the indian circus federation for short c responded positively but ironically this body has very thin representation from the circus industry with approximately less than 10 of the big circuses and probably less than 20 of all the circuses were members of this federation 7 it is submitted that the petitioner convened meeting with the circus owners on the 18th and 19th august 2003 where few owners under the umbrella of c agreed to make h bachpan bachao andolan union of india 359 ors dalveer bhandari declaration that there shall be no further use of children in the circuses in india and full list of the children employed by them will be provided to the petitioner and that they would voluntarily phase out all the children from their circuses in time bound manner it was also decided that the petitioner and its partner non governmental organizations for short ngos in nepal will help in repatriation and rehabilitation of liberated children 8 the petitioner submitted that since the c does not have enough influence even on its own members the agreement did not get implemented however the petitioner kept on receiving information and complaints from several parents through the ngos working in nepal the petitioner sent the staff of his organization to cross check and reconfirm the factsin bhairawa hetauda in nepal and siliguri in india and found that organized crime of trafficking of children for indian circuses particularly from nepal is rampant in february and march 2004 the petitioner received complaints from many nepalese parents whose children have been trapped in circuses for more than 10 years and had never been allowed to meet them on one pretext or the other even after repeated requests to the circus owners majority of the complaints were for the children in the great indian circus non federation circus which was found to be located in palakkad kerala in june 2004 the petitioner came to know through credible ngos and individuals working in hetauda nepal that the daughters of 11 parents were trapped into great roman circus in india the petitioner has since then conducted several studies and interviews with various people who are engaged in circus 9 the petitioner further found that life of these children begins at dawn with training instructors shouting abuses merciless beatings and two biscuits and cup of tea after 3 to 5 shows and of lot of pervert comments of the crowds the young girls are allowed to go back to their tents around midnight even then life might have something else in store depending upon the nature and mood swings of the circus 360 supreme court reports 2011 5 c a owners and managers if any child complains about the inadequate amount of food or the leaking tent in the rain or if child is scared on the rope while performing the trapeze he she is scolded and maltreated by the managers or employers and sometimes even caned on one pretext or the other 10 there are no labour or any welfare laws which protect the rights of these children children are frequently physically emotionally and sexually abused in these places the most appalling aspect is that there is no direct legislation which is vested with powers to deal with the problems of the children who are trafficked into these circuses the police labour department or any other state agency is not prepared to deal with the issue of trafficking of girls from nepal holding them in bondage and unlawful confinement there is perpetual sexual harassment violation of the juvenile justice act and all international treaties and conventions related to human rights and child rights where india is signatory 11 the petitioner submitted that this court in the case of r nair others union of india others 2001 6 scc 84 upheld the rights of animals who are being made to perform in these circuses after understanding their plight the situation of children in circuses is no different if not worse 12 the petitioner has made various attempts to regulate and improve the conditions of children in circuses including engaging the circus owners association however none of them have derived good results it is categorically submitted that the petitioner does not want the circuses to be completely banned or prohibited but there is strong need to regulate this as any other industry including ensuring safety and other welfare measures of all those who are working in circuses particularly the children almost all the circuses employ at least 50 persons and therefore large number of labour laws should be applied 13 the petitioner seeks application of the provisions of the juvenile justice care and protection of children act 2000 bachpan bachao andolan union of india 361 ors dalveer bhandari and also suggests that intra state trafficking of young children their bondage and forcible confinements regular sexual harassment and abuses should be made cognizable offences under the indian penal code as well as under section 31 of the juvenile justice act children welfare committees under the juvenile justice care and protection of children act 2000 should be empowered to award compensation to all those victims rescued from the circuses with time bound rehabilitation packages and the state government to create fund of the same 14 mostly these children are sold to the circus owners either by the agents or their relatives or sometimes the poor parents are lured into the web by promising high salaries luxurious life etc however some exceptional circuses were also found only 4 that treated their employees marginally better and allowed them to avail the privilege of limited movement outside the circus campus for limited time but child labour was prevalent in these circuses as well and artists were not given minimum wages 15 the petitioner has complained about living and working conditions of the children and has enumerated the following broad categories which are setout as under insufficient space in almost all the circuses visited by the research team the living conditions were quite similar but nonetheless deplorable there are separate sleeping arrangements for males and females with the company girls segregated from the rest of the circus troupe by boundary there are also separate tents for the families working in the circuses usually 5 to10 and sometimes even more people are crammed into single tent thus most of the child artists complain of insufficient space and lack of personal space and privacy 362 supreme court reports 2011 5 c a ii meals most of the circuses provide two meals lunch and dinner to the artists and tea also two times from the canteen run by the management the quantity and quality of the food is variable depending on the management most often the food is inadequate to satisfy the appetite of young growing children iii sleep timings sleep timings are also very erratic depending upon the nature of the work being performed by the child artists though on general trend most go to bed at midnight after the last show is over to be woken up at dawn for practise iv poor sanitation there are no proper toilets and bathrooms make shift toilets are created on the circus ground near the tents and all the company girls have to share it and the stench around them is unbearable in general condition of sanitation in circuses is most pathetic it also precipitates unhygienic conditions that could lead to diseases invariably all the artists voiced their dissatisfaction on the issue of sanitation and hygiene no health care personnel another important issue concerning the artists is the lack of any health care personnel to look into their day to day health care needs as well as the accidents that are so common in the circuses the manger or the keeper usually provides medication for common ailments such as fever cold etc and looks into the first aid needs of the artists for serious medical condition or an accident during c e g bachpan bachao andolan union of india 363 ors dalveer bhandari training or performance the trainer or the manager usually accompanies the patient to the nearest medical help the management bears the charges of the treatment during that time but later deducts it from the salary of the incumbent however some managements do bear the medical bill of the artists if mishap occurs during the performance or training overall it can be said that the living conditions inside the premises of the circus arena are squalid and deplorable with no facilities and basic amenities being provided to the circus artists not even proper sanitation vi high risk factor nature of the activities in circuses is such that the risk factor for the artists is very high as accidents and mishaps during practise sessions and shows are common phenomenon on top of that there are no health care personnel employed by the circuses to look into the health care needs of the artists even at the time of emergency it was found that the lives of the children was endangered due to the risk factor involved in the circuses especially those who were involved in items like ring of death well of death sword items rope dance etc they constituted 10 of the total number of childr en rest 60 fell in the medium risk category while 30 were not involved in any risky items moreover some circuses either fail to or are ignorant about taking the necessary precautions which further heightens the risk involved in fact the research team witnessed an accident while visiting one of the circuses 364 supreme court reports 2011 5 c a vii remuneration besides paying meagre salaries to the children the management of some circuses holds back the salaries of the children saying that they would be paid only to their parents when they visit them which rarely happens salary accounts are often manipulated and the loss due to accidents or mishaps is not compensated viii bound by contract the child artists are brought to the circuses to be contracted for 3 to 10 years and once the contract is signed agreed upon by the parents or guardians of the children these young ignorant children are bound and indebted to the circw management and are unable to break away from the circus even if they are discontented with their lives in the circus ix daily routine hindering their all round development in the circus their daily routine starts with practising even before the sunrise rigorous training session initially mostly accompanied with verbal and physical abuse and harsh physical punishments at times for the slightest error or no error at all from afternoon onwards until midnight they are on the stage performing and enthralling the audience with their vivacity and wit they annot share their agony and grievances or raise their voice against the torturous life they are forced to lead for them there is no education no play no recreation and their life is confined to the circuses without any exposure to the outside world all this prohibits them from knowing the other opportunities available as they are aware of and are exposed to just one aspect c e g bachpan bachao an dolan union of india 365 ors dalveer bhandari b of life that is the aspect they see in the circuses they work in due to the cruel and inhuman attitude of the management in some circuses which imposes restrictions on the children for meeting their folks and also due to the traveling nature of the troupe most of the children end up losing contact with their parents especially those across the border or residing at far off places even within the country and those fortunate few who get chance to meet their parents do so once or twice year either when their parents visit or when they are allowed to go home consequently they are exposed to world which hinders their psychological spiritual and socio economic development with no knowledge of their rights duties and scope for better future and thus are 0 left with no other option but to continue working in the circuses for the rest of their lives instability in life due to the circus nomadic existence makes it difficult for them to pursue formal education resulting in large number of illiterate children and adults in circuses 16 the employment of the children in circus involves many legal complications and in that respect major complications are as under 1 2 3 deprivation of the children from getting educated thereby violates their fundamental right for education enshrined under article 21a of the constitution deprivation of the child from playing and expression of thoughts and feelings thereby violating the fundamental right to freedom of expression competency to enter into contract for working in circus 366 supreme court reports 2011 5 c b d f 4 violation of statutory provisions of law like employment of children act 1938 the children placing of labour act 1933 the child labour prohibition and regulation act 1986 minimum wages act 1976 the prevention of immoral

1961 etc 5 6 existing labour laws and legitimacy of contracts of employment for children the legitimacy of contracts of employment for children and working conditions 17 the petitioner has given innumerable instances in the petition of abuse of children in the circu es all those instances demonstrate under what horrible and inhumane conditions the children have to perform in the circuses 18 the experiences of the petitioner are only scratch on the surface and there are many children who are being trafficked regularly into circuses while it is not the case of the petitioner that circuses should be completely banned and prohibited there is strong need to regulate this as any other industry including ensuring safety gears and other measures as are done in other countries 19 the petitioner has filed the petition with the following prayers 1 issue writ of mandamus or any other appropriate writ order or direction directing the respondents to frame appropriate guidelines for the

remarked that child protection is an essential part of the country strategy to place development of the child at the centre of the 11th plan the national plan of action for children articulates ights

states on 50 50 cost sharing basis 52 it is submitted by the learned solicitor general that in order to give effect to the programme for juvenile justice it is necessary that nodal points have to be identified the child welfare committee is one such body but it is necessary that the working of the child welfare committee must be overseen by either the executive chairman of the legal services authority or by the high court itself it is also necessary that the financial assistance being provided for children in need and care must result in tangible results to the children whose future is sought to be rehabilitated for that purpose it is appropriate 384 supreme court reports 2011 5 c a that court monitored mechanism is established for every juvenile home district judge or judge nominated by the chief justice of the high court should be visitor there must be periodic internal reports which are given to the high court and just as in case of prisons juvenile homes must be monitored by courts and their living conditions must also be carefully examined 53 it is also submitted by the learned solicitor general that the point of responsibility for overseeing the conditions in the juvenile home must also be shared by the district magistrate of each district it is necessary that there should be dual reporting one to the judicial section of the high court and the other to the district magistracy and onwards to the state government each state government must open juvenile justice cell which will receive periodic reports of juvenile 0 homes the number of children the status of children the manner of rehabilitation and the current status the state government must also ensure that therapeutic help as well as psychiatric assistance wherever necessary is offered to the juveniles on top priority basis district collectors must submit their reports to the secretary of the department concerned who in turn must report to the chief secretary the chief secretary must be constructively responsible for the administration of the programme for juvenile justice and also must supervise the monetary spending and the manner in which the money spent has been duly accounted thus certification programme for spending monies based on central schemes must be introduced this certification must be by an independent authority that will ensure that the monies allocated have in fact been spent for the benefit and welfare of the children if the home is situated within panchayat area then the chairman of the panchayat or the zila parishad must be also made responsible for certifying that all the monies which were intended for the home in terms of grants or subventions have been duly utilised 54 it is further submitted by the learned solicitor general bachpan bachao

that occupational therapists must be able to assess on the basis of modern iq and aptitude tests about the way in which such children can be taken forward to mainstream living by offering vocational guidance offering children under difficult circumstances relevant support is an obligation and should not be matter of charity fortuitousness in terms of magnanimous dispensation f 55 learned solicitor general also gave suggestions as under child line services are provided for children in distress these should be catalogued and there should be g central registry which will provide information about the status of the child line services at the local level it should be the district magistrate who must be responsible for the effect running of the child line service a11 district

children who are engaged as domestic labour working at roadside dhabas and mechanic shops have to be rescued and bridge education has to be provided including vocational training this must be undertaken again by identifiable points of responsibility it is necessary that an executive magistrate must be allocated certain area to be covered where children are rescued this should be undertaken by district magistrate dividing his district in suitable divisions where such executive magistrates can rescue working children they need to be rehabilitated it is important that rescue will be effective only when there is scope for rehabilitation it should not happen that in the name of rehabilitation children are put in detention homes or remand homes that would be an act of cruelty 56

lacking this pertains both to policies to strengthen and empower poor and vulnerable families to cope with economic and social hardship and challenges and thus be able to take care of their children as well as to efforts to raise awareness of all india people on child rights and child protection situation poor planning and coordination poor implementation of existing laws and legislations 388

be addressed by interventional orders of this court in the exercise of its extraordinary jurisdiction under the constitution points of implementation must be identified 58 learned solicitor general further submitted that each state government must identify an officer who is responsible for implementation of schemes in relation to children there must be parallel linkage between point of contact of the collectorate executive administration with point in legal aid e the executive chairman of the state legal services authority and point in the ngo sector civil society similarly points must be identified in each zila parishad and panchayat samiti and gram panchayats in fact the presiding officers of the gram nyayalayas may also be encouraged to identify children who are vulnerable and who need protection the integrated child protection scheme is presently in place it seeks to institutionalize essential services and strengthen structures it seeks to enhance capacities at all levels it

following rules of good governance and adhering to the professional and ethical code of conduct those agencies shall be reporting to and will be subject to rigorous auditing and supervision by responsible state bodies 59 the most outstanding feature of this scheme which needs to be implemented on full time and firm basis is the government civil society partnership this will involve active involvement of the voluntary sector research and training institutions law college students advocacy groups and the corporate sector it should be the duty of the health secretary of each state governmerit including under the chairmanship of the health secretary government of india to have blueprint for implementing the government civil society initiative it is necessary that there must be 6

the present national commission for protection of child rights which has taken pioneering efforts it is expected that on close interface between the national commission for protection of child rights

ors kamal mohan gupta n madhusoodhanan and sathish for the appearing parties the judgment of the court was delivered by dalveer bhandari 1 this petition has been filed in public interest under article 32 of the constitution in the wake 8 of serious violations and abuse of children who are forcefully detained in circuses in many instances without any access to their families under extreme inhuman conditions there are instances of sexual abuse on daily basis physical abuse as well as emotional abuse the children are deprived of basic human needs of food and water 2 it is stated in the petition that the petitioner has filed this petition following series of incidents where the petitioner came in contact with many children who were trafficked into performing in circuses the petitioner found that circus is one of the ancient forms of indigenous entertainment in the world with humans having major role to play however the activities that are undertaken in these circuses deprive the artists especially children of their basic fundamental rights most of them are trafficked from some poverty stricken areas of nepal as well as from backward districts of india the outside world has no meaning for them there is no life beyond the circus campus once they enter irito the circuses they are confined to the circus arena with no freedom of mobility and choice they are entrapped into the world of circuses for the rest of their lives leading vagrant tunnelled existence away from the hub of society which is tiresome claustrophobic and dependent on vicissitudes 3 it is submitted that the petitioner is engaged in social movement for the emancipation of children in exploitative labour bondage and servitude bachpan bachao andolan has been able to liberate thousands of children with the help of the judiciary and the executive as well as through persuasion social mobilization and education 358 supreme court repoi ts 2011 5 c a 4 it is submitted that for the first time the petitioner came to know about the plight of children in indian circuses way back in 1996 at that time the petitioner had rescued 18 girls from circus performing in vidisha district of madhya pradesh this was possible after complaint made by 12 year old girl who managed to escape from the circus premises her complaint was that she and several other nepalese girls had been trafficked and forced to stay and perform in the circus where they were being sexually abused and were kept in most inhuman conditions d 5 following this incident an organised attempt was made by the petitioner to understand and learn more about the problem of child labour in indian circuses and how to eradicate the same this began in july 2002 with the initiation of research on the problem of child labour in indian circuses the findings in the abovementioned research were compiled in report termed eliminating child labour from indian circuses 6 once all the above facts and figures were established the petitioner decided to implement multi pronged strategy to eradicate the practice of employing children in indian circuses simultaneously preparations were made to put across the problem in front of circus owners to make them aware of the moral and legal questions pertaining to the use of children in circuses the petitioner initiated dialogue with all the major circus owners and appealed to them to stop trafficking bondage child labour and other violations of child rights the indian circus federation for short c responded positively but ironically this body has very thin representation from the circus industry with approximately less than 10 of the big circuses and probably less than 20 of all the circuses were members of this federation 7 it is submitted that the petitioner convened meeting with the circus owners on the 18th and 19th august 2003 where few owners under the umbrella of c agreed to make h bachpan bachao andolan union of india 359 ors dalveer bhandari declaration that there shall be no further use of children in the circuses in india and full list of the children employed by them will be provided to the petitioner and that they would voluntarily phase out all the children from their circuses in time bound manner it was also decided that the petitioner and its partner non governmental organizations for short ngos in nepal will help in repatriation and rehabilitation of liberated children 8 the petitioner submitted that since the c does not have enough influence even on its own members the agreement did not get implemented however the petitioner kept on receiving information and complaints from several parents through the ngos working in nepal the petitioner sent the staff of his organization to cross check and reconfirm the factsin bhairawa hetauda in nepal and siliguri in india and found that organized crime of trafficking of children for indian circuses particularly from nepal is rampant in february and march 2004 the petitioner received complaints from many nepalese parents whose children have been trapped in circuses for more than 10 years and had never been allowed to meet them on one pretext or the other even after repeated requests to the circus owners majority of the complaints were for the children in the great indian circus non federation circus which was found to be located in palakkad kerala in june 2004 the petitioner came to know through credible ngos and individuals working in hetauda nepal that the daughters of 11 parents were trapped into great roman circus in india the petitioner has since then conducted several studies and interviews with various people who are engaged in circus 9 the petitioner further found that life of these children begins at dawn with training instructors shouting abuses merciless beatings and two biscuits and cup of tea after 3 to 5 shows and of lot of pervert comments of the crowds the young girls are allowed to go back to their tents around midnight even then life might have something else in store depending upon the nature and mood swings of the circus 360 supreme court reports 2011 5 c a owners and managers if any child complains about the inadequate amount of food or the leaking tent in the rain or if child is scared on the rope while performing the trapeze he she is scolded and maltreated by the managers or employers and sometimes even caned on one pretext or the other 10 there are no labour or any welfare laws which protect the rights of these children children are frequently physically emotionally and sexually abused in these places the most appalling aspect is that there is no direct legislation which is vested with powers to deal with the problems of the children who are trafficked into these circuses the police labour department or any other state agency is not prepared to deal with the issue of trafficking of girls from nepal holding them in bondage and unlawful confinement there is perpetual sexual harassment violation of the juvenile justice act and all international treaties and conventions related to human rights and child rights where india is signatory 11 the petitioner submitted that this court in the case of r nair others union of india others 2001 6 scc 84 upheld the rights of animals who are being made to perform in these circuses after understanding their plight the situation of children in circuses is no different if not worse 12 the petitioner has made various attempts to regulate and improve the conditions of children in circuses including engaging the circus owners association however none of them have derived good results it is categorically submitted that the petitioner does not want the circuses to be completely banned or prohibited but there is strong need to regulate this as any other industry including ensuring safety and other welfare measures of all those who are working in circuses particularly the children almost all the circuses employ at least 50 persons and therefore large number of labour laws should be applied 13 the petitioner seeks application of the provisions of the juvenile justice care and protection of children act 2000 bachpan bachao andolan union of india 361 ors dalveer bhandari and also suggests that intra state trafficking of young children their bondage and forcible confinements regular sexual harassment and abuses should be made cognizable offences under the indian penal code as well as under section 31 of the juvenile justice act children welfare committees under the juvenile justice care and protection of children act 2000 should be empowered to award compensation to all those victims rescued from the circuses with time bound rehabilitation packages and the state government to create fund of the same 14 mostly these children are sold to the circus owners either by the agents or their relatives or sometimes the poor parents are lured into the web by promising high salaries luxurious life etc however some exceptional circuses were also found only 4 that treated their employees marginally better and allowed them to avail the privilege of limited movement outside the circus campus for limited time but child labour was prevalent in these circuses as well and artists were not given minimum wages 15 the petitioner has complained about living and working conditions of the children and has enumerated the following broad categories which are setout as under insufficient space in almost all the circuses visited by the research team the living conditions were quite similar but nonetheless deplorable there are separate sleeping arrangements for males and females with the company girls segregated from the rest of the circus troupe by boundary there are also separate tents for the families working in the circuses usually 5 to10 and sometimes even more people are crammed into single tent thus most of the child artists complain of insufficient space and lack of personal space and privacy 362 supreme court reports 2011 5 c a ii meals most of the circuses provide two meals lunch and dinner to the artists and tea also two times from the canteen run by the management the quantity and quality of the food is variable depending on the management most often the food is inadequate to satisfy the appetite of young growing children iii sleep timings sleep timings are also very erratic depending upon the nature of the work being performed by the child artists though on general trend most go to bed at midnight after the last show is over to be woken up at dawn for practise iv poor sanitation there are no proper toilets and bathrooms make shift toilets are created on the circus ground near the tents and all the company girls have to share it and the stench around them is unbearable in general condition of sanitation in circuses is most pathetic it also precipitates unhygienic conditions that could lead to diseases invariably all the artists voiced their dissatisfaction on the issue of sanitation and hygiene no health care personnel another important issue concerning the artists is the lack of any health care personnel to look into their day to day health care needs as well as the accidents that are so common in the circuses the manger or the keeper usually provides medication for common ailments such as fever cold etc and looks into the first aid needs of the artists for serious medical condition or an accident during c e g bachpan bachao andolan union of india 363 ors dalveer bhandari training or performance the trainer or the manager usually accompanies the patient to the nearest medical help the management bears the charges of the treatment during that time but later deducts it from the salary of the incumbent however some managements do bear the medical bill of the artists if mishap occurs during the performance or training overall it can be said that the living conditions inside the premises of the circus arena are squalid and deplorable with no facilities and basic amenities being provided to the circus artists not even proper sanitation vi high risk factor nature of the activities in circuses is such that the risk factor for the artists is very high as accidents and mishaps during practise sessions and shows are common phenomenon on top of that there are no health care personnel employed by the circuses to look into the health care needs of the artists even at the time of emergency it was found that the lives of the children was endangered due to the risk factor involved in the circuses especially those who were involved in items like ring of death well of death sword items rope dance etc they constituted 10 of the total number of childr en rest 60 fell in the medium risk category while 30 were not involved in any risky items moreover some circuses either fail to or are ignorant about taking the necessary precautions which further heightens the risk involved in fact the research team witnessed an accident while visiting one of the circuses 364 supreme court reports 2011 5 c a vii remuneration besides paying meagre salaries to the children the management of some circuses holds back the salaries of the children saying that they would be paid only to their parents when they visit them which rarely happens salary accounts are often manipulated and the loss due to accidents or mishaps is not compensated viii bound by contract the child artists are brought to the circuses to be contracted for 3 to 10 years and once the contract is signed agreed upon by the parents or guardians of the children these young ignorant children are bound and indebted to the circw management and are unable to break away from the circus even if they are discontented with their lives in the circus ix daily routine hindering their all round development in the circus their daily routine starts with practising even before the sunrise rigorous training session initially mostly accompanied with verbal and physical abuse and harsh physical punishments at times for the slightest error or no error at all from afternoon onwards until midnight they are on the stage performing and enthralling the audience with their vivacity and wit they annot share their agony and grievances or raise their voice against the torturous life they are forced to lead for them there is no education no play no recreation and their life is confined to the circuses without any exposure to the outside world all this prohibits them from knowing the other opportunities available as they are aware of and are exposed to just one aspect c e g bachpan bachao an dolan union of india 365 ors dalveer bhandari b of life that is the aspect they see in the circuses they work in due to the cruel and inhuman attitude of the management in some circuses which imposes restrictions on the children for meeting their folks and also due to the traveling nature of the troupe most of the children end up losing contact with their parents especially those across the border or residing at far off places even within the country and those fortunate few who get chance to meet their parents do so once or twice year either when their parents visit or when they are allowed to go home consequently they are exposed to world which hinders their psychological spiritual and socio economic development with no knowledge of their rights duties and scope for better future and thus are 0 left with no other option but to continue working in the circuses for the rest of their lives instability in life due to the circus nomadic existence makes it difficult for them to pursue formal education resulting in large number of illiterate children and adults in circuses 16 the employment of the children in circus involves many legal complications and in that respect major complications are as under 1 2 3 deprivation of the children from getting educated thereby violates their fundamental right for education enshrined under article 21a of the constitution deprivation of the child from playing and expression of thoughts and feelings thereby violating the fundamental right to freedom of expression competency to enter into contract for working in circus 366 supreme court reports 2011 5 c b d f 4 violation of statutory provisions of law like employment of children act 1938 the children placing of labour act 1933 the child labour prohibition and regulation act 1986 minimum wages act 1976 the prevention of immoral traffic act equal remuneration act 1976 and rules made thereunder and the bonded labour system abolition act 1976 read with rules made their under the factories act 1948 motor transport workers act 1961 etc 5 6 existing labour laws and legitimacy of contracts of employment for children the legitimacy of contracts of employment for children and working conditions 17 the petitioner has given innumerable instances in the petition of abuse of children in the circu es all those instances demonstrate under what horrible and inhumane conditions the children have to perform in the circuses 18 the experiences of the petitioner are only scratch on the surface and there are many children who are being trafficked regularly into circuses while it is not the case of the petitioner that circuses should be completely banned and prohibited there is strong need to regulate this as any other industry including ensuring safety gears and other measures as are done in other countries 19 the petitioner has filed the petition with the following prayers 1 issue writ of mandamus or any other appropriate writ order or direction directing the respondents to frame appropriate guidelines for the

research also highlighted the fact that in the last decade the average age of the trafficked girl has steadily fallen from 14 to 16 years to 10 to 14 years these findings are supported by studies conducted by human rights watch asia in 1995 which stated that the average age of nepali girls trafficked into india dropped from 14 to 16 years in the 1980s to 10 to 14 years in 1991 despite the

about the trafficking of children in urban brothels and the regional variations the report describes how trafficking is undertaken 37 trafficking in women and children has become an increasingly lucrative business especially since the risk of being prosecuted is vey low women and children do not usually come to the brothels on their own will but are brought through highly systematic organized and illegal trafficking networks run by experienced individuals who buy transport and sell children into prostitution traffickers tend to work in groups and children being trafficked often change hands to ensure that neither the trafficker nor the child gets caught during transit different groups of traffickers include gang members police pimps and even politicians all working as nexus trafficking networks are well organized and have linkages both within the coun ry 378 supreme col rt reports 2011 5 c a and in the neighbouring countries most traffickers are men the role of women in

the city several times and know the hotels to stay in and the brokers to contact they frequently work in groups of two or more male and female traffickers are sometimes referred to as dalals and dalalis commission agents respectively and are either employed by brothel owner directly or operate independently often collusion of family members forms an integral part of trafficking with uncles

may forward report to this court for passing of appropriate orders in relation to the welfare of 0 the child 44 learned solicitor general submitted thatu1e power of rehabilitation is necessary the said power has been conferred under section 33 3 of the juvenile justice care and protection act 2000 the said provision provides that after the completion of the enquiry if the committee is of the opinion that the said child has no family or ostensible support it may allow the child to remain in the children home or shelter home till suitable rehabilitation is found for him or till he attains the age of 18 years 45 it is further submitted that rehabilitation will be the measure of success of the juvenile justice care and protection act 2000 reintegration into society by means of confident and assertive occupations leading to sense of self worth will have to be devised this requires innovative strategies and not any high flown claims to social development 46 the juvenile welfare board will have no competence to deal with cases of children who are in prostitution or have i 382 supreme court reports 2011 5 c a been trafficked such children are to be considered as children in need of care and protection however in states where the child welfare committees have not been constituted these matters should be referred to the juvenile welfare board it is submitted that the book on trafficking in women and children in india edited by shanker sen along with m nair ips is useful document in report called abolition of child labour in india submitted by the ncpcr to the planning commission certain useful perspectives are to be found 47 it is submitted that india is home to 19 of world c children more than one third of the country population around 440 million is below 18

2006 is concerned it was 3 86 and in 2006 2007 it was increased to 4 91 it is highly inadequate looking to the population of children 49 in report submitted by the ministry of women and child development 40 of india children have been declared to be vulnerable or experiencing difficult circumstances they are entitled to special protection under articles 14 15 16 17 21 23 and 24 of the

andolan union of india 383 ors dalveer bhandari to be adhered by all state parties in securing the best interest of the child 50 learned solicitor general submitted that the millennium development goals cannot be secured unless child protection is an integral part of programmes strategies and plans for their achievement the newly constituted ministry of women and child development has rightly remarked that child protection is an essential part of the country strategy to place development of the child at the centre of the 11th plan the national plan of action for children articulates ights agenda for the development of children 8 51 learned solicitor general further submitted that the existing child protection mechanisms have to be first noticed the delivery points however need to be strengthened to review the delivery of these programmes there must be nodal agencies points of responsibility have to be identified and strengthened the programme for juvenile justice is to enable children in need of care and protection and those in conflict with law to be secured the central governments provide financial assistance to the state governments ut administrations for establishment and maintenance of various homes salary of staff food and clothing for children in need of care and protection of juveniles in conflict with law financial assistance is based on proposals submitted by states on 50 50 cost sharing basis 52 it is submitted by the learned solicitor general that in order to give effect to the programme for juvenile justice it is necessary that nodal points have to be identified the child welfare committee is one such body but it is necessary that the working of the child welfare committee must be overseen by either the executive chairman of the legal services authority or by the high court itself it is also necessary that the financial assistance being provided for children in need and care must result in tangible results to the children whose future is sought to be rehabilitated for that purpose it is appropriate 384 supreme court reports 2011 5 c a that court monitored mechanism is established for every juvenile home district judge or judge nominated by the chief justice of the high court should be visitor there must be periodic internal reports which are given to the high court and just as in case of prisons juvenile homes must be monitored by courts and their living conditions must also be carefully examined 53 it is also submitted by the learned solicitor general that the point of responsibility for overseeing the conditions in the juvenile home must also be shared by the district magistrate of each district it is necessary that there should be dual reporting one to the judicial section of the high court and the other to the district magistracy and onwards to the state government each state government must open juvenile justice cell which will receive periodic reports of juvenile 0 homes the number of children the status of children the manner of rehabilitation and the current status the state government must also ensure that therapeutic help as well as psychiatric assistance wherever necessary is offered to the juveniles on top priority basis district collectors must submit their reports to the secretary of the department concerned who in turn must report to the chief secretary the chief secretary must be constructively responsible for the administration of the programme for juvenile justice and also must supervise the monetary spending and the manner in which the money spent has been duly accounted thus certification programme for spending monies based on central schemes must be introduced this certification must be by an independent authority that will ensure that the monies allocated have in fact been spent for the benefit and welfare of the children if the home is situated within panchayat area then the chairman of the panchayat or the zila parishad must be also made responsible for certifying that all the monies which were intended for the home in terms of grants or subventions have been duly utilised 54 it is further submitted by the learned solicitor general bachpan bachao andolan union of india 385 ors dalveer bhandari b that the integrated child protection programme for street children is also scheme by which ngos are supposed to run 24 hour shelters and to provide food clothing shelter non formal education recreation counseling guidance and referral services for children considering the vulnerability of the children all ngos must be directed to be registered with the concerned collector there must be database of every ngo including details of all the functionaries of the ngo with full particulars including their addresses in order to enable the enrolment in schools of street children vocational training occupational placement and to mobilize preventive health services including reduction of drug and substance abuse nodal point is necessary the nodal point must be either sub divisional magistrate executive magistrate whose work will be countersigned by subordinate judge appointed by the district judge of the district similarly database must be maintained in relation to the children their parentage present status and the present condition of their educational qualifications and whether they are capable of vocational training it is important that occupational therapists must be able to assess on the basis of modern iq and aptitude tests about the way in which such children can be taken forward to mainstream living by offering vocational guidance offering children under difficult circumstances relevant support is an obligation and should not be matter of charity fortuitousness in terms of magnanimous dispensation f 55 learned solicitor general also gave suggestions as under child line services are provided for children in distress these should be catalogued and there should be g central registry which will provide information about the status of the child line services at the local level it should be the district magistrate who must be responsible for the effect running of the child line service a11 district magistrates in the country must post on the website their child line service number 386 supreme court reports 2011 5 c a and must give effective publicity to the senices available and invite members of civil society to report any child in distress at numbers 8 shishu griha to promote in country adoption details of the working of the said scheme need to be collected and database must be maintained in respect of orphans abandoned destitute infants or children upto 6 years the adoptive parents must be obliged to give reports to the district judge who will in turn examine whether the adoptive parents have taken care of the child failing which adequate court monitored mei lsures may be necessary schemes for working children in need of care and protection this scheme is very important children who are engaged as domestic labour working at roadside dhabas and mechanic shops have to be rescued and bridge education has to be provided including vocational training this must be undertaken again by identifiable points of responsibility it is necessary that an executive magistrate must be allocated certain area to be covered where children are rescued this should be undertaken by district magistrate dividing his district in suitable divisions where such executive magistrates can rescue working children they need to be rehabilitated it is important that rescue will be effective only when there is scope for rehabilitation it should not happen that in the name of rehabilitation children are put in detention homes or remand homes that would be an act of cruelty 56 learned solicitor general further gave suggestions including pilot project to combat the trafficking of women and children for commercial sexual exploitation as under pilot project to combat the trafficking of women and children for commercial sexual exploitation this is source and destination area for providing care and protection to trafficked and sexually abused women and children

opening up of special schools rehabilitation centers provide non formal education vocational training supplementary nutrition stipends etc to children withdrawn from employment nclp the ministry of women and child development has actually in an outstanding report identified the shortcomings and gaps in existing child protection institutions the reasons for limitations in effective implementation of programmes have been properly identified the reasons are as follows lack of prevention policies programmes and structures to prevent children from falling into difficult circumstances are mostly lacking this pertains both to policies to strengthen and empower poor and vulnerable families to cope with economic and social hardship and challenges and thus be able to take care of their children as well as to efforts to raise awareness of all india people on child rights and child protection situation poor planning and coordination poor implementation of existing laws and legislations 388 supreme court reports 2011 5 c a ii lack of linkages with essential lateral senices for children for example education health police judiciary senices for the disabled etc iii no mapping has been done

monitoring and evaluation of the juvenile justice system services are negligible relative to the needs ii iii most of the children in need of care and protection as well as their families do not get any support and senices resources for child protection are meagre and their utilization is extremely uneven across india inadequate outreach and funding of existing programmes results in marginal coverage even of children in extremely difficult situations iv ongoing large scale rural urban migration creates an enormous variety and number of problems related to social dislocation severe lack of shelter and rampant poverty most of which are not addressed at all vi lack of senices addressing the issues like child marriage female foeticide discrimination against the girl child etc little

are not available in all states and where they do exist they are run as any other institution under the jj act 2000 57 it is further submitted by the learned solicitor general that the above needs to be addressed by interventional orders of this court in the exercise of its extraordinary jurisdiction under the constitution points of implementation must be identified 58 learned solicitor general further submitted that each state government must identify an officer who is responsible for implementation of schemes in relation to children there must be parallel linkage between point of contact of the collectorate executive administration with point in legal aid e the executive chairman of the state legal services authority and point in the ngo sector civil society similarly points must be identified in each zila parishad and panchayat samiti and gram panchayats in fact the presiding officers of the gram nyayalayas may also be encouraged to identify children who are vulnerable and who need protection the integrated child protection scheme is presently in place it seeks to institutionalize essential services and strengthen structures it seeks to enhance capacities at all levels it seeks to create database and knowledge base for child protection services it needs to strengthen child protection at family and f 392 supreme court reports 2011 5 c a community level the guiding

following rules of good governance and adhering to the professional and ethical code of conduct those agencies shall be reporting to and will be subject to rigorous auditing and supervision by responsible state bodies 59 the most outstanding feature of this scheme which needs to be implemented on full time and firm basis is the government civil society partnership this will involve active involvement of the voluntary sector research and training institutions law college students advocacy groups and the corporate sector it should be the duty of the health secretary of each state governmerit including under the chairmanship of the health secretary government of india to have blueprint for implementing the government civil society initiative it is necessary that there must be 6

the present national commission for protection of child rights which has taken pioneering efforts it is expected that on close interface between the national commission for protection of child rights

down from the auto rickshaw told their names as tutun e applicant in bail application no 225 of 2022 and three victims 3 the bogus customer has interacted with the applicant tutun and they were discussing about the consideration and commission in the meantime raiding party members came there and they have disclosed their identity applicant tutun was searched certain currency notes and certain objectionable articles were found it was confirmed that the applicant tutun and wanted accused prashant baroi have indulged into woman trafficking and accordingly offence came to be registered under sections 366a 370 of the indian penal code and under sections 4 and 5 of the immoral traffic prevention act and under sections 8 and 12 of the protection of children from sexual offences act 4 during the investigation the police have recorded the statements of three victims and out of them victim aashu was found to be minor my attention is invited to different statements recorded of these victims they are as follows seema 3 9 34 ba 3184 of 2021 doc victim aashu statement recorded under section 161 of criminal procedure code on 28 03 2021 ii statement recorded under section 164 of the criminal procedure code before the court of the jmfc thane on 07 04 2021 victim pramila statement dated 19 05 2021 recorded by police ii her earlier statement under section 161 and under section 164 of the criminal procedure code they are not annexed to the charge sheet victim priti statement recorded by police on 28 03 2021 ii statement recorded under section 164 of the criminal procedure code dated 07 04 2021 iii statement recorded by police on 19 05 2021 5 the applicant chandraprakash in bail application no 3184 of 2021 was arrested subsequently on the basis of the facts disclosed during the investigation even though both these applicants are arrested in one offence allegations against them are different so far as the applicant tutun is concerned there is no seema 4 9 34 ba 3184 of 2021 doc allegation that he has raped either girl or woman 6 on reading the bare act of the indian penal code it reveals that section 376 2 was omitted from statute book on 21 04 2018 it says about committing rape on woman when she is under 16 years of age 7 learned advocate for the victim submitted that even though it is omitted still section 4 of the protection of children from sexual offences act is invoked against applicant tutun the police might have invoked wrong section now it is for them to take care when the trial will go on before the concerned court according to the learned advocate only the sections under the immoral traffic prevention act can at the most be attracted they are invoked sections 4 8 and 12 of the said act it is contended that section 8 is punishable for maximum period of six months whereas under section 4 the punishment may extend to two years if victim is of the age of 18 years according to the learned advocate for the applicant after reading the statement of the victim aashu it can be very well said that the applicant has not lived on earning after utilizing services of the said aashu 8 seema whereas learned advocate for the applicant 5 9 34 ba 3184 of 2021 doc chandraprakash in bail application no 3184 of 2021 pointed various inconsistencies in between the statements of these three victims he submitted that the victim has changed the version and even she has changed the place of the offence 9 both the learned advocates submitted that there are various inconsistencies in between the statements of all these victims and if they were put to trial it is difficult to believe them 10 learned advocate for the victims submitted that so far as applicant chandraprakash is concerned the provisions of sections 4 and 5 of the protection of children from sexual offences act are invoked and there is maximum punishment upto life imprisonment learned app also opposed the bail considering the material on record 11 have perused the statements given by the victim aashu on 28 03 2021 and before the learned magistrate on 07 04 2021 in her statement under section 161 she has referred to one pandit who misbehaved with her she has also said that he had sexually intercoursed with her by asking her to drink some powder whereas in her statement under section 164 she has named one person by name tapas who called her on 25 03 2021 and the said tapas had seema 6 9 34 ba 3184 of 2021 doc arranged customer and said customer ravished her his description is mentioned the said customer is shown as the applicant chandraprakash according to the prosecution 12 have also read the statement of pramila dated 19 05 2021 in that statement she has referred to one tapas who is one of the applicant the said tapas called her on 26 03 2021 13 have also read the statement of victim priti dated 19 05 2021 in that statement she has explained as to how she gave statement before the police and before the court 14 if we will read the various statements given by these three victims it can be said that they have changed their versions out of these three victims two are major whereas victim aashu is minor 15 now the issue is whether both these applicants can be given benefit of these variances at this stage one can certainly say that the victim aashu has said about sexual intercourse committed with her no doubt she has not named the accused learned advocate tried to differentiate in between the place mentioned in both these statements 16 seema it is true that this applicant chandraprakash has given 7 9 34 ba 3184 of 2021 doc statement on 30 03 2021 as per section 27 of the indian evidence act and liquor and md powder were recovered at his instance even my attention is invited to avernments in ground no to para no 3 of the bail application filed before the court of additional sessions judge my attention is also invited to ground no 6 of the present application so also the victim aashu has made reference of one tutun who according to the prosecution is the applicant who was found when the police visited the hotel on 27 03 2021 17 for the above discussion am not inclined to grant bail to both of these applicants the court cannot overlook the fact that these victims come under different background one does not know their financial conditions in normal circumstances the accused can be given benefit of these variances but the offence is against society involving women the victims may be victim of the circumstances 18 so do not think that they can be granted bail the statement of aashu recorded under section 164 of the criminal procedure code mentions the name of tapas and as per section 4 and 7 of the protection of children from sexual offences act the maximum punishment is life imprisonment so far as applicant seema 8 9 34 ba 3184 of 2021 doc chandraprakash is concerned there is memorandum statement and in all these circumstances considered together it shows his involvement 19 so do not think that discretion can be exercised in their favour hence both applications are rejected the trial court is directed to expedite the trial and finish it as early as possible m modak seema 9 9 '],

on the promise of better life have instead being led by the appellant to the dungeons of darkness seemingly oblivious to the apathy of such victims the sole purpose being of financial gains human trafficking is one of the worst forms of crime and as the investigation suggests the appellant seems to have mastered such inhuman craft 18 we thus on consideration of the entire facts of the case

the government of india recognizes that human trafficking is grave crime and attaches high importance to the efforts directed at preventing and countering human trafficking human trafficking is highly organized crime often involving interstate gangs by criminal law amendment act 2013 section 370 of the indian penal code was substituted with modified section 370 and new section 370 was also inserted these sections provide comprehensive definition of human trafficking and also provide for strict punishment to be awarded to the offenders for exploitation of trafficked person following sections of indian penal code are also relevant in the context of trafficking in persons section 366 procuration of minor girls section 366 importation of girls from foreign country section 372 selling of girls for prostitution section 373 buying of girls for prostitution other legislations which deal with trafficking related crimes are the immoral traffic prevention act 1956 the prohibition of child

human organs and tissues act 1994 protection of children from sexual offences pocso act 2012 police and public order are state list subjects under the seventh schedule to the constitution of india therefore the primary responsibility to maintain law and order as well as prevention investigation and prosecution of the crime of human trafficking vests with respective state governments who are competent to deal with such offences under extant provisions of law given the fact that human trafficking is serious crime the government of india has been supplementing the efforts of the state governments to address the issue in comprehensive manner by way of the following measures initiatives an anti trafficking cell has been established in mha since 2006 which acts as an interface with all central ministries departments and the state ut governments in addressing the issue of human trafficking establishment of ahtus the government of india through its scheme under nirbhaya fund has

has been noted that concerned officers in states and uts sometimes lack awareness and training and at times fail to register cases under relevant sections of ipc resulting in ineffective prosecution conviction rate etc motivating and updating the knowledge base of the officers dealing with human trafficking is considered essential for which states need to make special efforts and provide them adequate training and resource material etc on periodic basis in case the states need any specific training resources the same can be organised by the bureau and police research development for which request can be made to them strengthening cooperation and establishing inter state channels of communication is essential which the states and uts need to work in close coordination with each other an

2764 general administration spl law order department government of telangana dated t5 12 202t 2 heard the learned counsel for petitioner learned assistant government pleader for home for the respondents and perused the reco rd 3 the case of the petitioner is that basing on recent solitary crime registered against the detenue viz crime no 551 of 2o2l of meerpet police station rachakonda commissionerate the respondent no 4 passed the impugned detention order dated 04 70 2021 according to respondent no 4 the detenue is irnr noral traffic offender and that she has been organizing 2 dt saj js w no 7l4 of 2022 prostitution by procuring girls from uganda country and other parts of state by means of human trafficking through her agents and engaging herself in unlawful acts of organizing prostitution clandestinely by acting as leader member of criminal gang to make quick money in short period and living on the earnings of the prostitution the immoral activities of the detenue lead to social unrest and widespread health hazards thereby endangering public health and are thus prejudicial to the maintenance of public order subsequently the impugned detention order was confirmed by the government vide o rt o 27 64 dated 15 12 2021 4 learned counsel for the petitioner would contend that the impugned detention order has been passed in mechanical manner and without application of mind already criminal law was set into motion against the detenue further the detenue was granted conditional bail by the court concerned in the solitary crime relied by the detaining authority and she has been complying the bail conditions but she was again sent to jail by invoking the draconian preventive detention laws on the apprehension that there is imminent possibility of her indulging in similar offences which is unjustified the alleged crime does not add up to disturbing the public order and it is confined within the ambit and scope of the word law and order since the offence alleged is under the indian dr sa js w no 714 of2022 penal code and the immoral traffic prevention act 1956 for short ta the detenue can ceftainly be tried and convicted under the penal code and the said special law thus there was no need for the detaining authority to invoke the draconian preventive detention law against the detenue hence the impugned orders tantamount to colourable exercise of power the impugned orders are legally unsustainable and ultimately prayed to allow the writ petition as prayed for 5 on the other hand the learned assistant government pleader for home appearing for the respondents supported the impugned orders and submitted that the detenue is an immoral traffic offender she along with her associates had been organizing prostitution by procuring girls from uganda country and others parts of telangana state by means of human trafficking through her agents the immoral activities of the defenue not only endanger the family system but also harmful to the inhabitants of the locality creating embarrassing situation to the families college going students and youth living in rachakonda police commissionerate further her immoral activities are leading to social unrest causing widespread health hazards therefore the detaining authority was tegally justified in passing the impugned detention order further the advisory board rendered its opinion that there is sufficient cause 4 dr sa jsj p no 714 of 2022 for detention of the detenue and on considering the same along with theentirematerial thegovernmentconfirmedtheimpugned detention order vide o rt no 2764 dated 15 t2 2021 all the were strictly followed by the detaining the impugned detention order the authority while passing impugned orders are legally sustainable and ultimately prayed to mandatory requirements dismiss the writ petition 6 inviewofthesubmissionsmadebyboththesides thepoint that arises for determination in this writ petition is whether the impugned detention order vide no 124 pd 1ell ccrb rckd 2021 dated 04 10 2021 passed by the respondent no 4 and the consequential confirmation order vide o rt no 2764 general administration spl law order department government of telanqana dated 15 12 2027 are liable to be set aside point 7 in catena of cases the hon ble supreme court had clearly opinedthatthereisavastdifferencebetween lawandorder and public order the offences committed against pa rticu la order and when the individual fall within the ambit of law and public at large is adversely affected by the criminal activities of person such activities of that person are said to disturb the public order moreover individual cases can be dealt with by the criminal dr sa js w no 7l4 of 2022 justice system therefore there is no need for the detaining authority to invoke the draconian preventive detention laws against an individual hence according to the hon ble apex court the detaining authority should be wary of invoking the immense power under the act 8 in ram manohar lohia state of biharl the hon ble supreme court has in fact deprecated the invoking of the preventive law in order to tackle law and order problem it was observed that every breach of public peace and every violation of law may create law and order problem but does not necessarily create problem of public order the distinction has to be borne in mind in view of what has been stated in the grounds of detention 9 in kanu biswas state of west benga 2 the hon ble apex court while discussing the meaning of word public order held that the question whether man has only committed breach of law and order or has acted in manner likely to cause disturbance of the public order is question of degree and extent of the reach of the act upon the society 1o in the present case the detaining authority basing on solitary crime indicated above has passed the impugned detention air 1966 sc z4o lr972l 3 scc 83 6 dt saj js w no 714 of2022 order dated o4 1o 2o21 we

sections 3 4 5 of pita cognizable 11 as seen from the material placed on record the solitary crime relied upon by the detaining authority for preventively detaining the detenue relates to immoral trafficking the crime was detected on 29 07 2021 and the detenue was remanded to judicial custody on 3o o7 2ozl thereafter the detenue moved bail petition before the court concerned and the court concerned vide order dated 29 o9 2021 granted bail to the detenue by imposing certain conditions the conditions imposed in the bail order are that the detenue shall execute personal bond for rs 10 000 with two sureties after release she shall appear before the sho meerpet police station on every wednesday between 09 00 am and 04 00 pm till filing of charge sheet it is stated in the counter affidavit that at present the case is under investigation it is the bounden duty of the police to inform the learned public prosecutor about the conduct of 7 dr sa js w no 7l4 of 2022 the detenue and to hand over the entire case record available against the detenue the police are supposed to be vigilant in collecting the whole data against the detenue and furnish the same to the public prosecutor additional public prosecutor to defeat the bail application of the detenue even assuming that the bail conditions are violated by the detenue and she is involved in further crimes noting prevents the prosecution to apprise the same to the concerned court and seek cancellation of bail by virtue of the conditions imposed in the bail order the detenue would be under surveillance of the court and the police l2 further this is clear cut case of non application of mind by the detaining authority the subjective satisfaction recorded by the detaining authority in the impugned detention order dated 04 to zozl reads as follows even though the hon ble court granted conditional bail to appear before sho concerned on particular day it was purely time bound and surueillance over proposed detenue by the police is only for that particular day o she sim minutes sians her attendance book leaves the oolice station and other hanl lbcre is ppssjbjlity of the prodosed detenue for oh court for relaxino conditions imdosed bv trial adoroac hin court criminal activities on d 13 subjective satisfaction for detaining person under preventive detention laws should be based on existing and relevant material if the detaining authority with clear application of mind to the documents and without reference to any extraneous matter takes 8 dr j js w no 7 14 ol 2oz2 into consideration the materiar which is germane rerevant not vague and not indefinite then this court wourd not normaily interfere with the same since the drastic power of preventive detention deprives the citizen of his her freedom without triar and fuil fredged opportunity for him her to prove his innocence utmost care should be taken in recording the subject satisfaction to detain person under preventive detention laws in the instant case the above extracted portion of the impugned detention order is extraneous and irrelevant further it is legal right of every accused to move higher courts seeking relaxation modification of the conditions imposed by the trial court while granting bail in any event the above extracted portion of detention order shourd not and cannot form part of the subjective satisfaction for passing detention order against the detenue 14 under these circumstances the apprehension of the detaininq authority that since the detenue was granted bair there is imminent possibility of her committing simirar offence which is detrimentar to the public order unless she is prevented from doing so by an appropriate order of detention is highly misplaced moreover criminal law was already set detenue further there is no antecedent criminal history against the detenue since the detenue has allegedly committed offences punishable under into motion against the 7 9 dr sa js w no 7i4 ot 2022 the indian penal code and pita the said crime can be effectively dealt with under the provisions of the penal code and the special law and there was no need for the detaining authority to invoke draconian preventive detention laws the detaininq authority cannot be permitted to subvert supplant or substitute the punitive law of land by ready resort to preventive detention 15 as held in vijay narain singh state of bihar3 single act or omission cannot be characterized as habitual act because the idea of habit involves an element of persistence and tendency to commit or repeat similar offences which is patently not present in the instant case 16 grave as the offence may be it relates to immoral trafficking so no inference of disturbance of public order can be drawn the subject case can certainly be tried under the penal code and special law thus this case does not fall within the ambit of the words public order instead it falls within the scope of the words law and order hence there was no need for the detaining authority to pass the impugned detention order l7 in the result the writ petition is allowed the impugned detention order vide no 124lpd cell ccrb rckd 2o2l dated 04 lo

section 370 3 of p was later on added the charge sheet had been filed against the applicant and another and from which it was evident that there was no prima facie evidence that the applicant had trafficked the two girls from delhi as of now one victim was released and deported to kirgizstan while the whereabouts of the other victim was not known one of the accused suspect in this case was already released on bail pursuant to the orders of this court and therefore on the grounds of parity the applicant too was entitled to the benefit of bail 3 shri gaurish nagvekar learned addl public prosecutor submitted that raid was conducted at vagator on the basis 3 cr a no 48 2020 of prior reliable information that two persons were indulging in prostitution he adverted to the statements of the victim girls who clearly implicated the applicant in the crime he referred to his reply and submitted that the applicant who had come on student visa had overstayed his stay in india and was involved in the present offence concerning human trafficking there was every possibility that the applicant would impede the trial if enlarged on bail and looking to the seriousness and the gravity of the offence he was not to be enlarged on bail there was also every possibility that he could threaten the victim girls in this case which would hamper the investigation moreover he was having criminal antecedents and looking to all the aspects of the case and the seriousness of the offence and more particularly section 370 3 i c he was not entitled to be released on bail shri nagvekar further submitted that the applicant was not entitled to any parity as the earlier accused had filed form however such details were not available in respect of the applicant 4 shri poulekar learned advocate in his reply submitted that the police had submitted his form alongwith the charge sheet and in which the details of his passport and other details were given 5 would consider the submissions the records of the case and decide the application accordingly 4 cr a no 48 2020 6 it is apparent that the applicant stands charged for the offence of human trafficking in terms of section 370 3 p which entails punishment of not less than 10 years but which can extend to an imprisonment for life and also the liability to pay fine no doubt the offence under section 370 i c deals with the exploitation of person entails punishment which shall not be less than 5 years but which shall extend upto seven years nonetheless looking to the seriousness of the offence of trafficking contained in section 370 3 p on that count alone the applicant would not be entitled to the benefit of bail moreover have perused the statements of the victim on record and from which it is apparent that the applicant had constructive role to play involving the victim girls in prostitution activities in goa and collecting money from them as his commission the applicant is national of turkiminstan while the victim girls are the nationals of turkiminstan and kirgizstan respectively the applicant has crossed the borders and indulged in such activities despite having come to this country on student visa and otherwise overstayed his visit for which he is charged accordingly and apparently to face trial before the learned judicial magistrate first class 7 he sought for his release on bail on the grounds of parity but do not find any reason to draw such parity with 5 cr a no 48 2020 the case of the applicant with that of ms abykeeva aliana who has been enlarged on bail looking also to the fact that she has furnished her form and other particulars to the police including the deposit of her passport the offences under section 370 and 370 3 p are on the increase read with section 4 and 5 of the immoral traffic prevention act 1956 and looking to the role played by the applicant in the crime which is of grave and serious nature he would not be entitled to the benefit of bail even on the so called grounds of parity the role of the applicant is required to be unearthed to find out his participation in procuring the victim girls and using them for prostitution activities in this state of goa the possibility of the applicant fleeing from justice cannot also be ruled out as remote no case whatsoever is made out for his release on bail and therefore in the absence of any merits in the

approached this court seeking bail in crm db 1477 of 2022 during the hearing of the matter this court was surprised to note without reference to any judicial or statutory authority the investigating agency had unilaterally de sealed the guest house being disturbed by the irregularity in the investigational process this court was constrained to issue direction upon 2 the commissioner of police bidhannagar commissionerate to take steps for protection of the vulnerable witnesses particularly the minor commissioner of police was also directed that cases involving trafficking of women particularly minors for sexual exploitation are transferred to the anti human trafficking units and investigated by specialsed officers preferably lady officers directions were also given for protection and support to the minors in the form of support person counselling and interim compensation was also provided when the present bail application came up for hearing we were apprised by mr dastoor the minor victims have not supported the prosecution case perusal of their evidence shows their versions were patently absurd and they were hiding the truth they had been won over and had come out with ludicrous version in court to protect the offenders from the aforesaid state of affairs it appears directions of this court to provide protection assistance and counselling to the minor victims were turned into mere lip service and hardly had any impact at the ground level under such circumstances we directed secretary high court legal services authority to appoint learned advocate to represent the minor victims at that stage mr shekhar barman entered appearance on behalf of one of the major victims and submitted she and another victim had been arrayed as accuseds in this case noting such fact by order dated 1st september 2022 we called upon the investigating 3 officer to explain why victims of sexual exploitation were arrayed as accuseds pursuant to such direction affidavit is filed before us from the affidavit it appears that the raid at the guest house had been conducted by one ashis deb the then inspector in charge of bidhannagar south police station for reasons best known to the officers he arrested two victims of sexual exploitation along with the minors who were present at the house they were produced before the jurisdictional court as accused persons and remanded to custody the deponent who is the investigating officer of the case did not pray for their discharge but proceeded to treat them as accused persons and filed charge sheet though during hearing of their bail applications learned public prosecutor stated they ought not to be arraigned as accuseds charges were mechanically framed against them under sections 366a 370 341 of the indian penal code sections 3 4 5 6 7 9 of the immoral traffic prevention act 1956 and section 17 of the pocso act in support of his showing the aforesaid victims as accused the investigating officer referred to the evidence of one of the minor victims who stated that she was returning home along with one of them when one of the accused took them to the guest house we are unable to understand how such statement creates even semblance of an impression that the major victims were hand in glove with the accuseds in the case 4 there is no legally admissible evidence against the two major victims which justify the charges framed against them the aforesaid conspectus of events clearly show how the process of law instead of protecting the victims of sexual exploitation have been abused in the hands of ignorant and insensitive agencies the investigating agency arrested the victims and they suffered custodial detention for 60 days mechanically adverting to the facts of the case the prosecution proposed and the trial court framed charges against them and put them on trial this is unfortunately an egregious example of secondary victimisation of victims of sexual exploitation having noticed such facts it becomes incumbent on the part of this court to exercise its inherent powers to set the law in its proper course and extend immediate succor to the victims we are conscious that we are considering bail prayer of an accused whatever be the nature of jurisdiction invoked every court particularly superior court while exercising such jurisdiction continues to possess inherent powers inherent powers of court are to be exercised ex debitio justitiae to ensure the interest of justice is upheld and any injustice meted out to an individual particularly victim of sexual exploitation as in the present case is immediately extinguished exercising such wholesome jurisdiction is the bounden duty of every court to uphold the rule of law and ensure justice is done 5 we have meticulously gone through the materials on record but are unable to find even an iota of legally admissible material which would give rise to any inference far less reasonable one that the major victims of sexual exploitation whose names have not been disclosed in this order can be arrayed as accuseds in the present case hence continuation of the proceeding against them is wholly unwarranted vexatious and requires to be quashed at the earliest accordingly we set aside the charges framed against the said major victims of sexual offences we are further of the view these victims are vital witnesses whose examination is most essential for just decision of the case hence we direct that the major victims who had been illegally arrayed as accuseds be examined as court witnesses by the trial court in exercise of power under section 311 of the code of criminal procedure in view of the aforesaid circumstances which show malevolent impact on vital witnesses who had turned hostile during trial and as we have proposed other victims of sexual exploitation to be examined as witnesses we do not consider it prudent to enlarge the petitioner on bail at present accordingly the prayer for bail of the petitioner is rejected we request the trial court to pass appropriate orders in accordance with the directions given by us hereinabove and examine the major victims of sexual exploitation as court 6 witnesses at the earliest and conclude the trial within six months from the next date fixed before the said court having noticed the callous indifferent and insensitive manner in which the present case has been handled we direct the director general of police and inspector general of police west bengal to take appropriate steps including disciplinary proceedings against ashis deb the then inspector in charge who without any legal justification arrested the major victims of sexual exploitation as well as the investigating officer who filed charge sheet against them without any credible material showing their complicity in the crime we also express our displeasure at the mechanical way in which the charges were framed against the said victim by the judge in the present case we direct the member secretary state legal services authority to forthwith release interim compensation to all the victims including the minor ones immediately if not already done

whereupon when he was taking that girl to delhi alongwith him and had reached near panipat mobile phone of that girl had switched off and for that reason that girl had contacted someone through his jatin mobile and the person with whom she had talked had disclosed his name to him jatin as zuber and further that zuber had told him that one boy will send him location from mobile number 96671 56859 and had asked him jatin to drop the victim on that location and thereafter on receiving location of badarpur delhi from the aforesaid number he had dropped 4 crmpm no 570 2022 the victim at badarpur

nazim sameer was in kerala he had further revealed that both of them had informed him that one named girl victim would come in some vehicle at badarpur ntpc gate and they had asked him to take her to his quarter and further that on request of these two persons he had taken the victim from badarpur ntpc gate to his room in akash building and had kept her in his room on 5 3 2021 and 6 3 2021 and on 7 3 2021 he had taken the victim to dhakia and as he was anticipating that police would be in his search therefore he was not sleeping in his room but was staying with his friend 5 crmpm no 570 2022 the petitioner had also disclosed that victim at the time of investigation was in dhakia and his elder brother istiyaak who is serving at delhi and living with him in the same room had also gone to village sahaspur near dhakia and on his message he would come to badarpur alongwith victim the petitioner had also disclosed that nazim sameer was intending to marry victim and nazim sameer and zuber had called victim to delhi but zuber was at that time at chennai and nazim sameer was in kerala and therefore victim was housed with him 9 on 8 3 2021 at about 9 30 m istiyaak brother of petitioner ibrahim and nasrin on message had brought victim to police station badarpur delhi who was identified by her father and thereafter victim had identified the places where she was dropped from the car and also the room of petitioner ibrahim 10 on 10 3 2021 statement of victim was also recorded under section 164 cr c and considering the circumstances revealed during investigation and from statement of victim sections 366a 370 4 506 and 120b ipc were also added in the case as per record age of victim is 14 years 11 months 11 during investigation it has also come that nazim sameer had been in contact of victim since last five months after sending her friend requests on facebook and thereafter 6 crmpm no 570 2022 they were in regular contact of the victim and it has been contended that the petitioner was an active participant in commission of offence as he received the victim at badarpur from taxi driver and thereafter kept her in his room and managed her shifting from badarpur to the house of ivad and nasrin 12 victim in her statement recorded under section 164 cr c has stated that she received friendship request on the facebook and repeated messages from juber and he was threatening that in case she did not come he will kill her and her family members and would upload her photographs on facebook and as zuber was forcing her daily through such messages she left her home for delhi and she was guided to board bus of delhi and to alight from the bus at the place where the bus would stop she has further stated that zuber had booked taxi from ambala to badarpur and that zuber was not messaging her from his own phone but from the phone of another boy namely sameer e nazim and when nazim came to know that zuber was doing wrong with her then he made call to his friend ibrahim petitioner and asked him to receive her whereupon ibrahim came to the place where taxi had to arrive wherefrom she was taken by ibrahim to his house and during that period ibrahim had apprised her about the wrong which was going to occur with her she has further stated that nazim and ibrahim had asked mobile number of her father so 7 crmpm no 570 2022 that they could take her to her parents and when zuber came to know that she was staying with ibrahim he started threatening both of them and forced them not to send her back with assertion that wherever she was he would be coming to take her alongwith him to kerala she has stated that p police traced the number of zuber and when he came to know about it he made call to one girl namely sonali and told her false story that her victim father used to beat and coerce her but sonali reported it to the police and made statement to the police disclosing the address where she victim was staying and police traced the number of ibrahim and on next day ibrahim left her in the house of nazim and thereafter p police took ibrahim with them and inquired about her whereabouts whereupon ibrahim disclosed her address and brother of ibrahim brought her to the police where her father was also present 13 learned counsel for the petitioner has contended that petitioner was not having any role in alluring or enticing the victim to leave her home he was asked by his friend nazim to help the victim by making arrangement for her stay as she was alone having no shelter in delhi and he was not knowing anything about the plan either of zuber or of nazim he has further submitted that zuber or nazim would be able to disclose the real facts but the petitioner had come into picture only when he received the victim and arranged for her stay on 8 crmpm no 570 2022 their request it has been further submitted that the petitioner kept the victim safely firstly at his place and thereafter when he again and again asked nazim to relieve him from the responsibility of the victim nazim had asked him to take the victim to his sister house and accordingly petitioner had acted and handed over the victim to the sister of nazim for safety of the victim as well as to relieve himself from responsibility of the victim 14 learned counsel for the petitioner submits that petitioner was acting innocently and was not having any knowledge about the conspiracy if any between nazim and zuber and he knew the facts not more than the facts and circumstances disclosed to him either by nazim or zuber or victim and on smelling something wrong he was repeatedly calling zuber and nazim to relieve him from responsibility of the victim and ultimately he had handed over the victim in the hands of sister of nazim 15 learned additional advocate general has pointed out that in earlier petition cr mp no 609 of 2021 it was submitted on behalf of petitioner that he had received the girl on the request of main accused mohammad nazim and mohammad zuber and during night time he was not having any other option but to keep the girl in his room for her safety and that number of calls between the petitioner and the main accused were for the reason that the petitioner had been 9 crmpm no 570 2022 asking and pressurizing the main accused to make arrangement for the girl who was received by the petitioner on request of main accused it was also submitted that petitioner was never intending to keep the girl in his room but for her safety he had kept her in his room without harming her in any manner and therefore as suggested and guided by main accused nazim and zuber the petitioner had handed over the girl to sister of main accused and therefore petitioner was not at fault nor was he having knowledge about intention of the main accused if any and thus even if prosecution story of conspiracy regarding trafficking of the girl is believed then also petitioner had never been party to such plan of the main accused according to the learned counsel had it been so the petitioner would not have kept the victim in his safe custody for two days and there was no overt act on the part of petitioner in leaving of the house by the victim rather victim had voluntarily left her house and when she reached delhi the petitioner had only helped her by providing shelter to her 16 reiterating the stand of the state taken in earlier bail applications of the petitioner learned additional advocate general has submitted that call detail record cdr of accused nazim zuber and ibrahim establishes that petitioner had not only facilitated the commission of offence but also was an active party in trafficking the victim from one place to other to establish participation of petitioner in conspiracy to commit 10 crmpm no 570 2022 the offence he has referred to cdr from 5 3 2021 to 6 3 2021 indicating that petitioner was in continuous contact with main accused mohammed nazim and zuber and during this period there are more than 100 calls between them it has been further submitted that there was big conspiracy to traffic the victim to dubai or any other foreign country via kerala or otherwise wherein petitioner has active role and therefore he does not deserve to be enlarged on bail as on his release there is every possibility of his fleeing from justice and it would be very difficult to apprehend him so the learned additional advocate general has prayed for dismissal of the bail application 17 learned additional advocate general has submitted that zuber was calling messaging the petitioner from the phone of nazim sameer and therefore impression of the victim as given by nazim or by the petitioner is farce he has submitted that all of them have connived with each other to force the victim to leave her home and then to transmit her to dubai and it is case of human trafficking by zuber and nazir with the help of others involved in the entire episode and petitioner ibrahim is one of such persons having an active role in the commission of offence 18 it has been pointed out by learned additional advocate general that though petitioner cleverly has succeeded to create an impression to the victim that she was 11 crmpm no 570 2022 helped by him and nazim but from statement of victim recorded under section 164 cr c it is evident that they were also active partners in commission of offence because it has come in statement of victim that juber was contacting her through mobile phone of nazim sameer and further after knowing that police had reached delhi and traced ibrahim on his mobile instead of handing over the victim to the police petitioner took her to village of nazim sister and hid himself had he been innocent and helping the girl he would have come forward and would have handed over the girl to the police and father of the girl 19 learned additional advocate general has submitted that the petitioner alongwith main accused has planned in such clever way that physically it is not visible that they have any role in the commission of offence as they managed to believe leaving of house by the girl to be an act committed by her at her own volition and when the girl reached ambala they managed taxi of third person for her arrival at delhi and the petitioner came in picture only at delhi at the time of receiving the girl leaving no evidence available to disclose the role of petitioner and other co accused in trafficking the girl from shimla to delhi and their plan to traffic her to foreign country could not be materialized for minority of the girl it has further been submitted that had the petitioner been acting bonafide he would not have hidden himself in the room of his friend on 12 crmpm no 570 2022 account of fear of raid by the police in his room according to learned additional advocate general petitioner conduct reflects that he is one of main conspirators and knowing the result of his participation in the commission of offence 20 learned additional advocate general has submitted that there is no change in circumstances since dismissal of previous bail application till date and that keeping in view the nature gravity and seriousness of offence for the manner in which victim has been managed to be transported travelled from shimla to remote village of uttar pradesh in an organized manner bail application deserves to be dismissed 21 in earlier petitioner cr mp no 609 of 2021 filed by the petitioner this court had observed as under 16 undoubtedly as pleaded by learned counsel for the petitioner bail is rule and jail is exception but at the same time this rule does not mean that in every case bail is to be granted in all eventualities the supreme court in its various pronouncements as also referred by this court in state of sandeep state of himachal pradesh reported in 2019 1 shim lc 263 has culled out various factors and parameters to be taken into consideration at the time of deciding the bail applications which also include denial of bail based on those factors and principles the general rule bail but not jail cannot be used as weapon to render the provisions empowering the court to reject the bail redundant and or as guiding factor to enlarge an accused on bail in every case 17 it has been stated in the status report that the case in the trial court is fixed for consideration of charges on 27 12 2021 it has further been stated that petitioner has been found actively involved in receiving the girl keeping her with him and instead of informing the police or her parents about her arrival at delhi he 13 crmpm no 570 2022 has shifted her to remote village in uttar pradesh and thereafter hide himself in the room of his friend to avoid police raid in his room to conceal the arrival of the girl at delhi therefore it has been contended by the learned additional advocate general that at this initial stage of trial when there is no change in circumstance release of the petitioner on bail would have adverse impact on the in society encouraging the commission of offence of trafficking the women within and out of country law breakers involved 22 first bail application of the petitioner was dismissed on 9 8 2021 thereafter petitioner had preferred cr mp no 2082 of 2021 which was dismissed on 7 12 2021 learned counsel for the petitioner has failed to point out change in circumstance thereafter as on date 23 without commenting upon the merits of the case considering entire facts and circumstances brought before me and taking into consideration the factors and parameters required to be considered at the time of considering bail application am of the opinion that at this stage petitioner is not entitled for bail 24 observations made in this petition hereinbefore shall not affect the merits of the case in any manner and are strictly confined for the disposal of the present bail petition accordingly the bail application is dismissed and disposed of may 12 2022 sd vivek

the co accused persons accordingly on her complaint case was registered by anti human trafficking unit of the petitioner on 24 02 2012 vi since 04 02 2011 and till she was rescued she was repeatedly

traffickers were arrested by the anti human trafficking unit including the respondent the respondent was arrested on 22 03 2012 ix three cases were filed by which the petitioner could break the organized racket of traffickers in delhi to some extent and arrested as many as 21 traffickers who were involved in trafficking of minors for the purpose of their commercial exploitation on completion of investigation charge sheet under section 120 read with sections 343 344 366a 376 420 506 of ipc and section 4 and 5 of the immoral traffic prevention act 1956 was filed by the petitioner on 22 05 2012 xi the charges were framed against the accused persons on 17 07 2013 the victim child was examined as pw 3 but her crl mc 4444 2013 page 4 of 19 examination could not be concluded thereafter on 06 09 2013 she was further examined cross examined and discharged on 09 09 2013 an application for grant of bail was filed by the respondent which was opposed by the petitioner the bail application was heard by the learned trial court and respondent was admitted to bail 3 feeling aggrieved by this order the petition has been filed for cancellation of bail on the ground that the trial court has granted bail to the respondent mainly on two grounds firstly that during her deposition victim child has made substantial improvements qua allegations against accused and secondly that accused is in custody for last 18 months the impugned order is against the settled principles of law and is liable to be set aside because the learned trial court has merely considered the improvements in the evidence of victim child but has not given due weightage to the following facts that she has correctly identified the accused in court in her examination on 17 07 2013 ii it was stated by her that accused sanjana had sent her to pandit respondent herein at munirka crl mc 4444 2013 page 5 of 19 iii pandit had given money to sanjana iv she stayed there for two days pandit had galat kaam with her vi besides him about 8 9 persons used to do galat kaam with her vii she also proved the pointing out memo of the house of pandit as ex pw3 viii she also proved the identification memo regarding the identification of pandit as ex pw3 ix she also stated that when she used to stay in the house of pandit he used to lock the door from outside she also named pandit in her statement recorded under section 164 cr c xi she has denied the suggestion that she did not visit the house of any accused with cbi officials xii she stated that she visited the house of ajay and pandit with cbi officials xiii she has denied the suggestion that she did not make any allegation against pandit in her statement on 02 03 2013 or that she did not stay with him at munirka or that crl mc 4444 2013 page 6 of 19 virender who was present in the court is not pandit or that she has falsely implicated the accused at the instance of the investigating officer of the case 4 it was alleged that if the court wanted to consider the evidence of the victim child due weightage should have been given to the entire evidence and the same should not have been read in piecemeal as such it was submitted that the impugned order be set aside and directions be given for re arrest of the respondent 5 notice of this application was given to the respondent who appeared in person with sh davindra hora advocate however learned counsel for the respondent submitted that he does not wish to file any reply to the application 6 have heard ms sonia mathur standing counsel for cbi and davinder hora advocate for the respondent and have perused the record 7 it was submitted by learned counsel for the petitioner that the trial court has passed the impugned order while granting bail to the respondent mainly on two grounds firstly that during her deposition the victim child has made substantial improvement qua allegations crl mc 4444 2013 page 7 of 19 against the accused and secondly that accused is in custody for the last 18 months impugned order is against the settled principles of law at the stage of consideration of bail the court can only go into the question of prima facie case established for granting bail it cannot go into the question of credibility and reliability of the witnesses put up by the prosecution the question of credibility and reliability of the prosecution witnesses can only be tested during the trial by the impugned order the trial court has virtually acquitted the accused of all the charges leveled against him even before completion of trial learned trial court has not given due weightage to the fact that the prosecutrix has correctly identified the accused in court during her examination on 17th july 2013 she has deposed against the respondent stating therein that he had given money to sanjana and stayed at his house for two days during which period he did galat kaam with her besides him 8 9 other persons used to do galat kaam with her daily she also identified him correctly and proved the pointing out memo of the house of the accused her statement under section 164 cr c was also recorded wherein she gave detailed version including the role played by the accused the crl mc 4444 2013 page 8 of 19 allegations are very serious it was complete racket which was indulging in child abuse the modus operandi was to bring minor girls of poor background from various parts of the country on the false pretext of providing suitable jobs to them and subsequently these poor girls were being raped and sexually exploited by the traffickers for monetary considerations by ways of three cases the petitioner could break the organized racket of the traffickers in delhi to some extent and arrested as many as 21 traffickers who are involved in the trafficking of minors for the purpose of their commercial sexual exploitation keeping in view the seriousness of the allegations which have been totally ignored by the trial court bail is liable to be cancelled reliance was placed on puran vs ram bilas and anr 2001 6 scc 338 state of up through cbi vs amarmani tripathi 2005 8 scc 21 and satish jaggi vs state of chhattisgarh ors 2007 11 scc 195 8 per contra it was submitted by the learned counsel for the respondent that the impugned order does not call for any interference as such there is no merit in the application and the same is liable to be dismissed crl mc 4444 2013 page 9 of 19 9 have given my thoughtful consideration to the respective submissions of learned counsel for the parties and have perused the record 10 it is well settled that the matters to be considered in an application for grant of bail are whether there is any prima facie or reasonable ground to believe that the accused had committed the offence ii nature and gravity of the charge iii severity of the punishment in the event of conviction iv danger of accused absconding or fleeing if released on bail character behavior means position and standing of the accused vi likelihood of the offence being repeated vii reasonable apprehension of the witnesses being tampered with and viii danger of course of justice being thwarted by grant of bail vide prahlad singh bhati nct delhi 2001 4 scc 280 and gurcharan singh state delhi administration 1978 1 scc 118 xii dealing with this aspect of the matter in amarmani tripathi supra hon ble apex court referred to the following principles relating to grant or refusal of bail as stated in kalyan chandra sarkar rajesh ranjan 2004 7 scc 528 crl mc 4444 2013 page 10 of 19 11 the law in regard to grant or refusal of bail is very well settled the court granting bail should exercise its discretion in judicious manner and not as matter of course though at the stage of granting bail detailed examination of evidence and elaborate documentation of the merit of the case need not be undertaken there is need to indicate in such orders reasons for prima facie concluding why bail was being granted particularly where the accused is charged of having committed serious offence any order devoid of such reasons would suffer from non application of mind it is also necessary for the court granting bail to consider among other circumstances the following factors also before granting bail they are the nature of accusation and the severity of punishment in case of conviction and the nature of supporting evidence reasonable apprehension of tampering with the witness or apprehension of threat to the complainant prima facie satisfaction of the court in support of see ram govind upadhyay sudarshan singh 2002 3 scc 598 and puran ram bilas 2001 6 scc 338 the charge xiii it was further held the condition laid down under section 437 1 is sine qua non for granting bail even under section 439 of the code in the impugned order it is noticed that the high court has given the period of incarceration already undergone by the unlikelihood of trial concluding in the near future as grounds sufficient to enlarge the accused on bail in spite of the fact that the accused stands charged of offences punishable with life imprisonment or even death penalty in such cases in our opinion the mere fact that the accused has undergone certain period of the accused and crl mc 4444 2013 page 11 of 19 incarceration three years in this case by itself would not entitle the accused to be enlarged on bail nor the fact that the trial is not likely to be concluded in the near future either by itself or coupled with the period of incarceration would be sufficient for enlarging the appellant on bail when the gravity of the offence alleged there are allegations of tampering with the witnesses by the accused during the period he was on bail is severe and 14 reference was made to panchanan mishra digambar mishra 2005 3 scc 143 wherein the hon ble supreme court observed 13 the object underlying the cancellation of bail is to protect the fair trial and secure justice being done to the society by preventing the accused who is set at liberty by the bail order from tampering with the evidence in the heinous crime it hardly requires to be stated that once person is released on bail in serious criminal cases where the punishment is quite stringent and deterrent the accused in order to get away from the clutches of the same indulge in various the prosecution tampering with activities witnesses threatening the family members of the deceased victim and also create problems of law and order situation like that the general rule this court will not ordinarily interfere in matters relating to bail is subject to exceptions where there are special circumstances and when the basic requirements for grant of bail are completely ignored by the high court see pawan ram prakash pandey 2002 cri lj2940 ram pratap yadav mitra sen yada 2003 1 scc 15 and kalyan chandra sarkar rajesh ranjan 2004 cri lj1796 crl mc 4444 2013 page 12 of 19 15 in puran supra it was observed generally speaking the grounds for cancellation of bail broadly are interference or attempt to interfere with the due course of administration of justice or evasion or attempt to evade the due course of justice or abuse of the concession granted to the accused in any manner however these instances are merely illustrative and not exhaustive one such ground for cancellation of bail would be where ignoring material and evidence on record perverse order granting bail is passed in heinous crime of this nature and that too without giving any reasons such an order would be against principles of law interest of justice would also require that such perverse order be set aside and bail be cancelled it must be remembered that such offences are on the rise and have very serious impact on the society therefore an arbitrary and wrong exercise of discretion by the trial court has to be corrected further it is to be kept in mind that the concept of setting aside the unjustified illegal or perverse order is totally different from the concept of cancelling the bail on the ground that accused has misconducted himself or because of some new facts requiring such cancellation 16 in satish jaggi supra it was observed in granting or non granting of bail in non bailable offence the primary consideration is the nature and gravity of the offence at the stage of granting of bail the court can only go into the question of the prima facie case established for granting bail it cannot go into the question of credibility and reliability of the witnesses put up by the prosecution the question of crl mc 4444 2013 page 13 of 19 credibility and reliability of prosecution witnesses can only be tested during the trial 17 in that case the bail was granted by the high court the matter went to the supreme court for cancellation of bail it was case under section 302 120b ipc it was observed that while granting bail the high court did not consider the nature and gravity of the offence and its impact on the society it recorded findings on credibility and reliability of witnesses at the stage of bail and virtually acquitted the accused even before trial such finding recorded at the stage of bail was held not to be sustainable the order granting bail was set aside 18 turning to the case in hand the allegations against the respondent are undisputedly very serious as per the prosecution case on receipt of an mail from an ngo namely mankind on action for rural growth marg based at 14 dali fatak darjeeling regarding missing of 14 year aged girl from darjeeling the victim child was rescued by anti human trafficking unit of the petitioner and during the course of investigation it was revealed that the child victim was forced to have sex with 8 10 customers daily and the accused persons were minting money from the said exploitation of crl mc 4444 2013 page 14 of 19 the poor child victim the modus operandi adopted by the accused persons involved in the business of fresh trade was that they were bringing minor girls of poor background from different parts of the country to delhi under false promise of providing suitable jobs to them and subsequently these poor girls were being raped and sexually exploited by the traffickers for monetary considerations the investigation further revealed that traffickers were residing in different colonies on rent basis and they were purchasing minor major girls for week time or so and the girls were subjected to forcible sex by 8 10 clients daily these traffickers were in touch with each other and they circulated these minor girls from one to another during investigation five traffickers were arrested by anti human trafficking unit including the respondent number of premises were raided by the anti human trafficking unit of the petitioner and during such raids two more minor girls were rescued besides two major girls in respect of two minor girls two separate cases were later registered and 21 traffickers were arrested who are involved in trafficking of minors for the purpose of their commercial sexual exploitation crl mc 4444 2013 page 15 of 19 19 under article 43 of the constitution of india trafficking in human is prohibited as held in geeta kancha tamang vs state of maharashtra 2010 crl lj 2755 such act constitutes the grossest violence of human rights of the victim child in state of maharashtra and anr vs mohd sajid hussain mohd hussain appeal crl 1402 1409 of 2007 decided on 10th october 2007 hon ble supreme court observed that immoral trafficking is now widespread victims who are lured coerced or threatened for the purpose of bringing them to the trade should be given all protection 20 in state of rajasthan vs om prakash 2002 crl lj2951 sc it was observed that child rape cases are cases of perverse lust for sex where even innocent children are not spared in pursuit of the sexual pleasure it cannot be more obscene than this it is crime against humanity in childline india foundation anr vs allan john waters ors 2011 crl j 2305 it was observed that children are the greatest gift of humanity the sexual abuse of children is one of the most heinous crimes it is appalling violation of their trust an ugly breach of our commitment to protect the innocent these are special safeguards in the constitution that apply specifically to crl mc 4444 2013 page 16 of 19 children the constitution has envisaged happy and healthy childhood for children which is free from abuse and exploitation 21 turning to the factual matrix of the case the respondent along with other accused was charged for offences under section 120b w section 342 343 344 366a 376 420 and 506 ipc w section 4 5 of the immoral traffic prevention act 1956 and substantive offences s 343 366a 376 of ipc and section 4 5 of immoral traffic prevention act 1956 the punishment prescribed s 366a is imprisonment which may extend to imprisonment for life punishment prescribed under section 5 of immoral traffic prevention act is for term of seven years which may extend to imprisonment for term of 14 years that being so the offence alleged against the accused is very serious in nature 22 the bail has been granted by learned additional sessions judge on two grounds only the victim has made substantial improvement qua allegations against the accused ii the accused is in custody for the last 18 months 23 as observed above in satish jaggi supra the court had granted bail to the accused facing trial in case s 302 120 ipc by crl mc 4444 2013 page 17 of 19 referring to the testimony of the witnesses and recording findings of their credibility and reliability it was held by hon ble supreme court that question of credibility and reliability of the prosecution witnesses can only be tested during the trial and the findings recorded by the high court virtually amounted to regular trial pointing out deficiency of reliability credibility of the prosecution witnesses which was totally unwarranted 24 in the instant case also the bail has been granted by observing that the victim has made substantial improvement qua allegations against the accused which affect the credibility and reliability of the victim learned public prosecutor for cbi led this court to the statement made by the victim under section 161 cr c as well as section 164 cr c wherein consistently she has made allegations against the accused regarding not only commission of rape upon her by him but also forcing her to have sex with 8 10 customers and that money was paid by the respondent to sanjana 25 the other factor which weighed with the learned trial court for releasing the accused on bail was that he was in custody for the last 18 months it is settled law that mere long period of incarceration crl mc 4444 2013 page 18 of 19 in jail by itself would not entitle the accused to be enlarged on bail as held in kalyan chandra shekhar vs rajesh ranjan pappu yadav and anr 2004 iv ad sc 309 shahnawazvs state of up 2009 cri lj 3839 meenu diwan vs state 2010 crl lj 2911 and uma charan vs state of up 2009 allahabad high court 26 for the reasons afore stated the order of learned additional sessions judge granting the bail is not sustainable in law it is accordingly set aside the bail bond and the surety of the respondent stands cancelled he is directed to be taken back to the custody forthwith the petition and the application stand disposed

petitions remains the same viz how to eradicate or at least reduce to significant wp crl no 619 of 2002 others page 2 of 54 level this peril in order to appreciate the issue we shall take note of the facts which have led to the filing of these writ petitions wp crl no 619 of 2002 2 kalpana pandit is the petitioner in this case whose daughter is espoused by social activist advocate ms aparna bhat the petitioner is domestic servant illiterate lady driven by poverty working as domestic servant in various houses from time to time to earn the minimum livelihood for her family and sustaining the family for fulfilling the daily needs her family has roots in west bengal however due to acute poverty and incapable to get any employment she came to delhi sometime in 1995 96 e five to six years ago before filing this writ petition the respondent no 4 viz sahyog placement sanstha is placement agency which makes arrangements for providing domestic helps to the residents of this city sometime in march 1999 the petitioner handed over her daughter to this sanstha whose sole proprietor is sunita sen for placement of her daughter as domestic help in some residence the reason was that the petitioner had fallen serious sick for long duration which compelled her to stay at home as she was not able to work because of the said sickness family in any case needed sustenance as there was nobody else to support the family financially no alternative was left to the petitioner to compel her daughter jharna to take up work wp crl no 619 of 2002 others page 3 of 54 3 jharna started working as domestic help at the residence of respondent no 4 she believed that her daughter would be safe and secure with sunita sen according to the petitioner she did not know that sunia sen who is one of placement agent would place jharna as domestic help in other people houses 4 it is averred in the petition that in april 1999 when the petitioner recovered from her illness she went to the house of sunita sen to meet her daughter and then only she came to know that jharna was working as housemaid at the residence of some mr mrs kaul in noida uttar pradesh she was shocked and surprised as no prior consent of the petitioner was obtained before taking such step and she was not even informed about this the petitioner pleads that with great difficulty she managed to get the phone number of her daughter employer and tried to contact her daughter jharna on that phone however she was not permitted to talk with jharna the petitioner was disturbed and tensed at the sudden disappearance of her daughter but could not be able to comprehend whom to approach for the help she went to the respondent no 4 again and respondent no 4 had arranged the petitioner to talk with her daughter jharna on telephone however she had no idea where the respondent no 4 had called she was concerned and worried about the safety of her growing daughter and wanted to meet her on the occasion of raksha bandhan she along with her son went to the noida house the address whereof was provided to the petitioner on phone wp crl no 619 of 2002 others page 4 of 54 however she could not be able to meet her daughter there she made repeated attempts for this purpose by visiting noida again and again but didn succeed her continues requests made to respondent no 4 also did not yield any results she even tried to approach mehrauli police station but was not provided with any help or guidance there as well while she was reconciling with the tragedy that had struck her after lapse of one and half years or so she was informed that her daughter jharna was missing since 29 08 2000 and the missing complaint had been lodged by jharna employer on 06 09 2000 to enquire about her daughter the petitioner was shocked to hear this and got in touch with the respondent no 4 the respondent no 4 even refused to hand over the copy of the alleged missing complaint in these circumstances the petitioner had no other option left but to approach the police station and to seek help to trace her daughter she lodged an fir in the vasant kunj police station on 02 02 2001 under section 363 of indian penal code that was registered as fir no 50 of 2001 however according to her no concrete steps were taken to investigate the allegation mentioned in the fir the petitioner viz had approached the juvenile welfare board jwb and filed case the jwb acted promptly on the petitioner complaint and summoned the respondent no 4 to attend the hearings but they did not consider it as important enough to attend the hearing and give the information they had regarding the whereabouts of the petitioner daughter however case did not progress much due to non appearance of the wp crl no 619 of 2002 others page 5 of 54 respondent no 4 the jwb had at last addressed letter to the deputy commissioner of police crime branch on 27 08 2001 and requested for thorough investigation into the incident but no headway was made she waited for quite some time as she was in dark about the whereabouts of her daughter jharna on 23 05 2002 she filed the instant petition in the nature of habeas corpus seeking direction against the respondent no 4 to produce the petitioner daughter jharna forthwith the state of nct delhi is impleaded in petition as the respondent no 1 the commissioner of police as respondent no 2 h vasant kunj police station as respondent no 3 sahyog placement sanstha owned by ms sunita sen as respondent no 4 and juvenile welfare board was impleaded as respondent no 5 5 obviously it was treated as habeas corpus petition and notice was issued to all the respondents on 30 05 2002 it was also directed that notice to the respondent no 4 be served through the h police station vasant kunj juvenile welfare board will ensure that record is produced in court alongwith the statement of respondent no 4 recorded by it on the next date e 31 05 2002 after perusing the report of the probation officer from jwb and the progress report from the investigation carried out by the police in fir no 50 2001 this court deemed it fit and proper to transfer the case to anti kidnapping cell crime branch delhi police to carry out further investigation and trace out the petitioner daughter the court also directed the employer of wp crl no 619 of 2002 others page 6 of 54 jharna viz mr veer kaul and mrs pammi kaul to be impleaded as respondents the matter went on from time to time thereafter giving directions to the police time and again to trace out the missing girl jharna 6 at the same time the issue of exploitation of children working as domestic helps and children going missing in the process was also taken note of during the discussions in this case it transpired that many such placement agencies would place children initially at some residence for domestic helps but such children would ultimately be forced into the flesh trade therefore the court also deemed it proper to address this issue as well in that proceedings the petition was also treated as public interest litigation keeping the importance of the issue involved an ngo known as butter flies intervened as was impleaded as respondent no 8 this aspect was highlighted in the order dated 04 10 2004 passed in this writ petition and we deem it proper to reproduce the same two distinct issues arise for consideration in this writ petition one of these relates to the tracing and production of the missing minor girl named jharna pandit reports submitted by the investigating agency from time to time show that steps to trace out the missing girl have been taken but without much success ms mukta gupta counsel for the respondent submits that efforts to trace the missing minor will continue and that as and when she is recovered she will be produced in this court for appropriate orders we need only say that the investigating agency shall take effective steps in the matter and report the progress to this court from time to time the second question that arises for consideration relates to the functioning of different placement agencies working in the nct of delhi it is pointed out by ms arpana bhatt that there are as many as 123 such agencies functioning in delhi these agencies apart from other placement work carried on by them engage themselves in placement of wp crl no 619 of 2002 others page 7 of 54 children in various establishments including as domestic help there is according to ms bhatt no statutory control over the functioning of these agencies the result is that children who are either picked up from the streets or brought from various other states to delhi are first placed as domestic help and later shifted to other more hazardous work including some who are pushed into prostitution the absence of any regulatory control over the functioning of these agencies which are run on commercial lines for profit according to the learned counsel defeats the very spirit of the juvenile justice care and protection of children act 2000 she submits that while section 31 of the said act vests the juvenile child welfare committees with extensive powers the absence of appropriate rules and regulations for the exercise of that power has virtually rendered the said provision nugatory she states that the child welfare committees functioning in delhi have received number of complaints regarding abuse of the children working as domestic helps in households verification of these complaints have according to her proved that the children have been subjected to various kinds of indignities and harassment including sexual abuse the record of the committees if summoned for perusal would according to the learned counsel enable this court to issue directions for effectuating the provisions of the act ms mukta gupta learned counsel for the respondent on the other hand submits that the government of delhi would have no objection to the issue raised before this court being examined and appropriate guidelines being evolved regulating the exercise of powers by the child welfare committees under the act she submits that the child welfare committees can be asked to submit report regarding the nature of the complaints received by them alleging abuse of children in domestic and other the establishments and committees have taken in this regard she further states that the state government can examine the matter more closely in order to provide an appropriate statutory for the exercise of the powers by the framework committees by framing of rules under section 68 of the act remedial steps which the in the circumstances therefore we direct that the child welfare committee in delhi shall before the next date of hearing submit to this court detailed report regarding the complaints received by them about child abuse in case where children are placed with households to work as domestic servants help the nature of the allegation as also the action which the committees have taken on the same the secretary social welfare department government of delhi shall also remain present and indicate whether any rules have been framed or can be framed in terms of section 68 read with 31 of the act aforementioned to regulate the exercise of the powers by the committees and in particular to regulate the functioning of the placement wp crl no 619 of 2002 others page 8 of 54 the agencies dealing with domestic child chairpersons of the two committees shall also be requested to remain present in the court on that day along with the relevant record labour 7 magnitude of the problem was taken note of in the orders of 25 10 2004 when the chairman of child welfare committee submitted their report in this behalf we would be well advised to reproduce that order as well we have heard

and sister in law from ajay thapa placement agency in his application he mentioned that his sister sister in law and her two friends were promised to get job by ajay thapa the said hembahadur was placed by ajay thapa in factory and his sister sister in law and their two friends were sent to work as domestic help for the last one year hembahadur was unable to contact his sister and her friends ajay thapa refused to provide him the contacts addresses of his sister and other girls this raised serious doubts in hembahadur mind that the girls had been sold by ajay thapa and he got very concerned for their welfare and under these circumstances he came in contact with bba activists and decided to take steps for finding and rescuing the girls 12 the petitioner approached the delhi commission for women on 12 01 2009 and with its help thereafter joint rescue operation was conducted on 13 01 2009 in the said operation 35 girls and 03 boys were rescued from some of these placement agencies wp crl no 619 of 2002 others page 12 of 54 already named above 23 out of 35 girls and three boys were below the age of 14 during the raid the team of delhi commission for women and the activists of bachpan bachao andolan and officials of delhi police saw lot of objectionable material including pornographic cds illicit literature pregnancy test kits and contraceptives etc raising doubts about the real purpose behind running of these placement agencies all the rescued girls and boys were trafficked from jharkhand and west bengal three rescued girls told that they were not given food from last three days most of the girls were staying at the office of placement agencies and forced to sleep in the rooms of boys clear picture of the same can be ascertained from the cd

saraswati vihar and then took them to child welfare committee of delhi government who sent these 23 minor girls to nirmal chaya and nari niketan for short stay the custody of three boys was given to

and children is spelt out in this petition these women and children were brought to delhi from different villages of west bengal it is stated that on reaching delhi they were sent to certain households and some of them had been shifted from time to time in such manner that the parents relatives of the victims are now unable to get in touch with them not only the promised wages are not paid but the women and children are being forcibly confined against their wishes and if any person attempts to get in touch with these victims then those persons were threatened by the placement agencies moreover the petitioner has even blamed the police force and has levelled the allegations that these placement agencies are doing aforesaid illegalities in collusion with police according to the petitioner they came to know of the problem when in may 2007 over 150 families from west bengal had approached the petitioner organization and complained that their wives sons and daughters had been taken by certain placement agents to delhi after promising to provide them with employment and thereafter these persons are not contactable and it is feared that their family members are being exploited accordingly the petitioner prepared chart of the complaints being made and copy of the said chart dated nil is attached the parents relatives of the trafficked victims brought to the notice of the petitioner that they have lost the contact with their wives children and that when they tried to contact the placement agencies they were not provided with the appropriate information regarding the whereabouts of their family members and some of wp crl no 619 of 2002 others page 14 of 54 them were threatened also that they fear for the lives and safety of their dear ones they all said that the money which was proposed to be paid by the way of salary was never paid and that only false assurances were given to them the petitioner has prepared compilation of over 150 complaints made to them by the parents relatives of the trafficked victims and craves leave to refer to and rely on the said compilation some of the persons who were earlier employed and who had managed to get back to west bengal had also met the petitioner organization and even complained that they were physically compelled to do forced labour some of them complained of sexual abuse by the employer petitioner has included these complaints along with the earlier compilation mentioned at the same time 10 agents who had taken the persons to delhi also contacted the petitioner organization they complained that the placement agencies were not paying and not ensuring payment to the persons as promised no accounts were being kept details of the whereabouts of the persons including minors were not being provided that they had received complaints from the persons including minors of beatings and sexual abuse and they had witnessed these as well those who were unwilling to work were being forced to work at the end of work the dues were not being paid nor any of the accounts were shown vouchers were also being forged with interpolations made in the vouchers regarding the amount paid so as to indicate larger amounts than the amounts that were actually paid some thumb impressions were taken on the vouchers which did not appear wp crl no 619 of 2002 others page 15 of 54 genuine in some cases the cheques had bounced the agents were also threatened by the placement agencies the agents were told that unless they provide new labour the persons currently working would not be allowed to leave the agents had also complained that some of the children were missing and they feared for the lives and safety of these missing children 14 members of the petitioner ngo in these circumstances came to delhi on 01 07 2007 and met various authorities including joint labour commissioner police etc however their encounter with these authorities was of no help and the allegations of disinterest and inaction on their part are stated in detail which need not be reproduced circumstances are being stated under which they could have rescued one minor girl kalpana sardar aged 12 years who has been placed in the shelter home of prayas in accordance with the orders of the child welfare committee she gave statement in writing to the police station narrating her harrowing experience and malpractices adopted by the

respondents apart from the prayer in the nature of habeas corpus that 256 women and children be produced before this court it is also prayed that proper action should be taken against these agencies and recover the wages of to rehabilitate and to pay compensation to the women and children concerned wp crl no 619 of 2002 others page 16 of 54 15 we may point out that by giving directions to the police in this petition from time to time most of the persons mentioned in the list in annexure i have been rescued re the problem and concerns 16 it is in the aforesaid factual backdrop of all the three cases the issue with which we are concerned relates to the forced child labour and regulation of placement agencies because of the commonalities of this issue in these three petitions were listed together from time to time and common orders were passed therein from particular stage however various directions were given in this behalf from time to time by this court on the basis of which steps were taken by the official respondents before we take stock of those directions and also the measures which have been taken by the respondents in addressing the issue it would be necessary to understand the genesis of problem and the circumstances under which it arises 17 trafficking in women and children is the gravest form of abuse and exploitation of human beings thousands of indians are trafficked everyday to some destination or the other and are forced to lead lives of slavery they are forced to survive in brothels factories guesthouses dance bars farms and even in the homes of well off indians with no control over their bodies and lives the indian constitution specifically bans the trafficking of persons article 23 wp crl no 619 of 2002 others page 17 of 54 in the fundamental rights part iii of the constitution prohibits traffic in human beings and other similar forms of forced labour though there is no concrete definition of trafficking it could be said that trafficking necessarily involves movement transportation of person by means of coercion or deceit and consequent exploitation leading to commercialization the abusers including the traffickers the recruiters the transporters the sellers the buyers the end users etc exploit the vulnerability of the trafficked person trafficking shows phenomenal increase with globalization increasing profit with little or no risk organized activities low priority in law enforcement etc aggravate the situation the income generated by trafficking is comparable to the money generated through trafficking in arms and drugs trafficking in human beings take place for the purpose of exploitation which in general could be categorized as sex based and non sex based the former category includes trafficking for prostitution commercial sexual abuse paedophilia pornography cyber sex and different types of disguised sexual exploitation that take place in some of the massage parlours beauty parlours bars and other manifestations like call girl racket friendship clubs etc non sex based trafficking could be for different types of servitude like domestic labour industrial labour adoption organ transplant camel racing marriage related rackets etc but the growing trafficking in women is principally for the purpose of prostitution prostitution is an international problem however we are aware of the fact that it is legalized in wp crl no 619 of 2002 others page 18 of 54 many countries around the globe unfortunately society remains tolerant of this abominable crime against women there are assorted ways of getting women into prostitution that are common to many countries then there are particular unique methods varies to country probably the three most common methods are false employment promises false marriages and kidnapping but what makes women and girls vulnerable are economic distress desertion by their spouses sexually exploitative social customs and family traditions in recent survey in india prostituted women cited the following reasons for their remaining in the trade reasons that have been echoed in all the concerned countries in descending order of significance they are poverty and unemployment lack of proper reintegration services lack of options stigma and adverse social attitudes family expectations and pressure resignation and acclimatization to the lifestyle the two principal indian laws that addresses the trafficking and prostitution in particular are the suppression of immoral traffic in women and girls act 1956 sita and the immoral traffic prevention act 1986 itpa colloquially called pita and amendment to sita neither law prohibits prostitution per se but both forbids commercialized vice and soliciting 18 india is said to have adopted tolerant approach to prostitution whereby an individual is free to carry on prostitution provided it is not an organized and commercialized vice however it commits itself to opposing trafficking as enshrined in article 23 of the wp crl no 619 of 2002 others page 19 of 54 constitution which prohibits trafficking in human beings india is also signatory to international conventions such as the convention on rights of the child 1989 convention on elimination of all forms of discrimination against women 1979 un protocol to prevent suppress and punish trafficking in persons especially women and children 2000 and the latest south asian association for regional cooperation saarc convention on preventing and combating trafficking in women and children for prostitution 2002 trafficked victim is therefore victim of multiplicity of crimes and extreme form of abuse and violation of human rights the constitution of india under article 23 specifically prohibits trafficking in human beings at present the legal regime to trafficking of women and children for commercial sexual exploitation includes the following indian penal code 1960 itpa 1956 j act 2000 special laws of various states rulings of supreme court and high court 19 there may be various problems while dealing with the issue of trafficking these petitioners seek to highlight limited facets of children being compelled to perform in circus and illegal trafficking in children and failure on the part of the law enforcement agencies as well as the society to protect the fundamental rights of the children the government had itself wp crl no 619 of 2002 others page 20 of 54 admitted the seriousness of the problem the report prepared by mr gopal subramanium learned solicitor general of india and submitted in bachpan bachao petition it is sated that the trafficking in human beings is not new phenomenon women children and men have been captured bought and sold in market places for decades human trafficking is one of the most lucrative criminal activities estimates of the united nations state that 1 to 4 million people are trafficked worldwide each year trafficking in women and children is an operation which is worth more than 10 billion annually the nhrc committee on missing children has the following statistics to offer 12 6 million governmental sources 100 million unofficial sources stated to be child labour 44 000 children are reported missing annually of which 11 000 get traced about 200 girls and women enter prostitution daily of which 20 are below 15 years of age international conventions exist to punish and suppress trafficking especially against women and children ref un protocol to prevent suppress and punish trafficking in persons also referred as the palermo protocol on trafficking trafficking is now defined as an organized crime against humanity the convention being an international convention is limited to cross border trafficking but wp crl no 619 of 2002 others page 21 of 54 does not address trafficking within the country the definition of trafficking is significant the recruitment transportation transfer harboring or receipt of persons by means of threat or use of force or other forms of coercion of abduction of fraud of deception of the abuse of power or of position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of person having control over another person for the purpose of exploitation it is further submitted by the learned solicitor general that children under 18 years of age cannot give valid consent it is further submitted that any recruitment transportation transfer harbouring or receipt of children for the purpose of exploitation is form of trafficking regardless of the means used three significant elements constitute trafficking b the action involving recruitment and transportation the means employed such as force coercion fraud or deception including abuse of power and bribes and the preliminary purpose being of exploitation including prostitution etc internationally there is working definition of child trafficking the working definition is clear because it incorporates the above three elements in june 2001 india has adopted the palermo protocol to evolve its working definition of child trafficking the forms and purposes of child trafficking may be bonded labour domestic work agricultural labour wp crl no 619 of 2002 others page 22 of 54 employment in construction activity carpet industry garment industry fish shrimp export other sites of work in the formal and informal economy trafficking can also be for illegal activities such as begging organ trade drug peddling and smuggling trafficking can be for sexual exploitation e forced prostitution socially and religiously sanctified forms of prostitution sex tourism pornography child trafficking can be to aid entertainment in sports circus dance troupes camel jockeying some problem of trafficking is highlighted only to show the plight of children and women who are taken as domestic help by dubious placement agencies and forced them into flesh trade 20 coming back to the medium of placement agencies poverty and lack of opportunity are major foundation of trafficking child wp crl no 619 of 2002 others page 23 of 54 trafficking typically begins with private arrangement between trafficker and family member driven by the family economic plight and the trafficker desire for profit and cheap labour someone comes along and says he or she has professions or jobs for the children and the parents believe it parents think that in letting children go they are doing something good for them but someone takes them as and makes them domestic workers and someone else takes all the money instead of giving them salary some crimes that are commonly concurrent with child trafficking or which child trafficking may initially appear to be are domestic violence child abuse or neglect child sexual abuse child pornography child labour violations 21 in this order however our focus has to be on the issue as to how to have proper control of administration over the placement agencies so that the exploitation of children is obliterated minimized to the possible extent as that is the issue raised in these petitioners are preferred re regulating the placement agencies 22 the main concern of all the counsel in these writ petitions was that there was no comprehensive legislation regulating the placement agencies to take care of the menace on the other hand there wp crl no 619 of 2002 others page 24 of 54 were multiple statutes and authorities under those statutes and the challenge was as to how to achieve the coordination to remove disconnect them it would be of use to mention that this has been the focus of the various proceedings in these writ petitions and directions were given from time to time though it is not necessary to take note of all those orders some of the important orders and directions passed in all these proceedings from time to time need look as that would pave the way for final direction which we propose to issue in this order in the order dated 04 10 2004 this court had highlighted two issues which arise in these writ petitions viz tracing and production of children on the one hand and functioning of different placement agencies working in nct of delhi on the other hand however directions were given to the government of nct delhi by that order to provide framework within which the placement agencies could be regulated and monitored orders dated 04 10 2004 is the springboard and therefore we reproduce the same two distinct issues arise for consideration in this writ petition one of these relates to the tracing and production of the missing minor girl named jharna pandit reports submitted by the investigating agency from time to time show that steps to trace out the missing girl have been taken but without much success ms mukta gupta counsel for the respondent submits that efforts to trace the missing minor will continue and that as and when she is recovered she will be produced in this court for appropriate orders we need only say that the investigating agency shall take effective steps in the matter and report the progress to this court from time to time the second question that arises for consideration relates to the functioning of different placement agencies working in the nct of delhi it is pointed out by ms aparna bhat that there are as many as 123 such agencies functioning in delhi these agencies apart from other placement work carried on by them engage themselves in placement of wp crl no 619 of 2002 others page 25 of 54 children in various establishments including as domestic help there is according to ms bhat no statutory control over the functioning of these agencies the result is that children who are either picked up from the streets or brought from various other states to delhi are first placed as domestic help and later shifted to other more hazardous work including some who are pushed into prostitution the absence of any regulatory control over the functioning of these agencies which are run on commercial lines for profit according to the learned counsel defeats the very spirit of the juvenile justice care and protection of children act 2000 she submits that while section 31 of the said act vests the juvenile child welfare committees with extensive powers the absence of appropriate rules and regulations for the exercise of that power has virtually rendered the said provision nugatory she states the child welfare committees functioning in delhi received number of complaints regarding abuse of the children working as domestic helps in households verification of these complaints have according to her proved that the children working as domestic helps in households verification of these complaints have according to her proved that the children have been subjected to various kinds of indignities and harassment including sexual abuse the record of the committees if summoned for perusal would according to the learned counsel enable this court to issue directions for effectuating the provisions of the act ms mukta gupta learned counsel for the respondent on the other hand submits that the government of delhi would have no objection to the issue raised before this court being examined and appropriate guidelines being evolved regulating the exercise of powers by the child welfare committees under the act she submits that the child welfare committees can be asked to submit report regarding the nature of the complaints received by them in domestic and other alleging abuse of children establishments and the committees have taken in this regard she further states that the state government can examine the matter more in order to provide an appropriate statutory closely framework for the exercise of the powers by the committees by framing of rules under section 68 of the act remedial steps which the in the circumstances therefore we direct that the child welfare committees in delhi shall before the next date of hearing submit to this court detailed report regarding the complaints received by them about child abuse in case where children are laced with households to work as domestic servants help the nature of the allegation as also the action which the committees have taken on the same the secretary social welfare department government of delhi shall also remain present and indicate whether any rules have been framed or can be framed in terms of section 68 read with 31 of the act aforementioned to wp crl no 619 of 2002 others page 26 of 54 regulate the exercise of the powers by committees and in particular to regulate the functioning of the placement agencies dealing with domestic child the chairpersons of the two committees shall also be requested to remain present in the court on that day along with the relevant record labour post on 25th october 2004 order dasti 23 pursuant to the aforesaid direction the state government filed the affidavit contending that it was not possible to frame guidelines for monitoring the placement agencies instead it was suggested that steps would be taken for making registration under the delhi shops and establishment act mandatory whereby the placement agencies could also be regulated the necessary amendment in the aforesaid act has since been made no doubt that may be big step for regulating the placement agencies the contour of the problem could not be checked merely with these amendments the counsel for the petitioners impressed upon the court that the court should also pass certain guidelines as well before it could be done counsel for the petitioners were asked to prepare comprehensive note indicating the existing legislation or rules and in the absence of any legislation to suggest the lines on which fresh legislation can be enacted for this purpose order in this behalf was passed on 08 12 2006 which reads as under after hearing learned counsel for the parties it appears that the writ petition has been filed only for registering regulating monitoring and supervising the working of placement agencies that provide employment to women and children as domestic help according to learned counsel for the petitioner some steps need to be taken to ensure that some responsibility is placed upon the placement agencies and they should not be allowed to carry on their activities unchecked because several instances of abuse of women and children who wp crl no 619 of 2002 others page 27 of 54 have been employed as domestic servants have come to the notice to the petitioner and others learned counsel for the petitioner says that she will prepare the existing comprehensive not which legislation or rules under which there is no existing legislation then the lines on which fresh legislation can be enacted for this purpose indicates learned counsel says the comprehensive note and give to the learned counsel for the state within three weeks learned counsel for the state will then give her reaction to the note that she will prepare it is made clear that the present writ petition pertains only to the registration regulation monitoring and supervision of placement agencies list the matter on 23rd january 2007 24 in response ms arpita bhat learned counsel appearing for the petitioner in wp crl no 619 of 2002 brought to the notice of this court the legal position contained in different statutes in the following manner registration as far as registration is concerned the proposal of the government to register them under the delhi shops and establishments act and make the registration mandatory is acceptable however following the registration process mechanism to regulate the manner in which the agencies function has to be created the petitioner makes the following proposal domestic workers who are being placed by the agencies can be classified as children and adults children will be between the age group of 14 and 18 years and the adults persons above 18 above children there are various dealing with the rights and welfare of three including children who are working children legislations which can be mentioned in this context are ii iii the child labour prohibition and regulation act 1986 the bonded labour system abolition act 1976 the juvenile justice care and protection of children act 2000 wp crl no 619 of 2002 others page 28 of 54 child labour prohibition and regulation act 1986 it has been seen that domestic labour is not given the status of labour by any legislation the child labour prohibition and regulation act 1986 sought to address the problem of child labour in the country the act has serious flaws nevertheless it does seek to regulate and prohibit child labour under certain circumstances the act applies to children upto the age of 14 years the act thereafter classifies work into two broad categories hazardous and non hazardous sectors it is submitted that while all the hazardous industries as classified by the act does fall within the hazardous industry there are large number of sectors which are left out in fact the ideal approach if at all the classification was necessary would have been to classify on the basis of processes rather than the end product from october 10 2006 domestic work has also been classified as falling under hazardous work in any event even though children below the age of 14 are prohibited from being employed there is very little that the act does to enable implementation of this principle some state governments understanding that domestic work was in fact making the child more vulnerable took some initiatives and had passed some local notifications and guidelines which had been in force before the notification of the central government banning child from domestic work came into force these are labour tamil nadu amendment to schedule under tamil nadu manual workers regulation and employment and conditions of work act under this particular amendment of january 28 2000 employment in domestic works was added to the said schedule of the act karnataka effective from 1st april 2004 amendment to the minimum wages act for the state of karnataka stipulations have been for the remuneration due to domestic help based on the nature of the work as well as the number of hours put in laid out washing utensils 45 minutes 150 washing utensils clothes house keeping taking care of children 8 hours 1600 there is also notification issued by the government of karnataka banning employment of child domestics by government employees even though the law has come into force there has not been any scheme or policy or guidelines which would wp crl no 619 of 2002 others page 29 of 54 the manner in which children already in indicate employment would be rescued and rehabilitated since domestic work has been now classified as hazardous industry by the act the regulation mechanisms within the act would come into play and the inspectors appointed under the act are under mandate to enforce the same the modalities of enforcement would be as per the rules prescribed under the act and the compensation payable would also be as per the provisions of the act the inspectors appointed under the act is made payable to the children juvenile justice care and protection of

in the written submissions filed by the petitioner in this writ petition 30 before we advert to these suggestions and direction which are required to be issued on that basis it would be necessary to comment that the state government as well as other governmental authorities have participated in these proceedings while playing the role of facilitator and has not acted in an adversarial manner this positive attitude of the respondent needs to be commended in fact the counsel for the respondents as well as respondent authorities in great measure joined the other counsel as well as the court in finding the solution to the problems 31 we may also record that mr gopal subramanium solicitor general of india who appeared in some stages of these proceedings had even prepared comprehensive report

operations of being trapped into false accusation is also risk for those engaged never simulate being the trafficker alone in order to establish proof it can happen that the representative of an ngo judges that she he can establish proof by playing the role of client interested in purchasing children this can easily turn against her him and she he may be obliged to prove at later stage that she he was in fact playing role operate in group of at least two or more persons if there is plan to follow the traffickers or trace deal as part of the preliminary enquiry if possible identify people or groups who can be fact potential finding investigation rescuing the child or in facilitating and participating in legal action for protecting the child and prosecuting the offender partners in where

be confidentiality of the child and due protection must be given to her him as witness to ensure the detailed interview of the victim should be done preferably by intervention centres members of the child welfare committee under the juvenile justice act there should be adequate breaks and intervals during the interview with child victim crisis if the police employ child friendly approach to the entire investigation the possibility of getting all relevant information gets higher this can be done by having supportive environment for the child at the police station wherein attention is paid to his needs this can be done at the police station itself or at any other place co managed by police and any ngo cbo support persons for the child should be contacted and in their absence any civil society group working with for children or members of cwc whoever the child feels comfortable with could be asked to the present due care must be maintained to attend to issues like interpreters

in the manner of discovering the ignipotent character of youth and children and particularly their capacity to be genuine authentic individuals of self worth and self esteem society which ignores children or is unconcerned about child rights will always bear the ignominy of being partial and selective society carrying the impost of elitism in india where rural poor exist and children work in

coordination and disconnect wp crl no 619 of 2002 others page 46 of 54 among them are not able to tackle the issue effectively therefore there is need to study this aspect viz feasibility of having legislation to regulate employment of problem of children and adult women who are working as domestic helps emphasis should be laid on the regulation of placement of agencies who provide such helps we are making these observations also for the reason that the existing laws do not provide and effective speedy remedial which could ensure that women and children are able to seek recovery and wages ensure freedom of movement access shelter option in case of abuse before being able to go home feasibility of having control of sdms of the areas on these placement agencies should also be worked out ii till that is achieved which is allowing term measure immediate concerned respondent authority to ensure as to how various enforcement agencies of different statutes are able to work in coordinated and cooperative manner necessary guidelines should be issued or rules framed in this behalf if possible single window enforcement agency be created so that the the ngo on behalf of such victims are able to wp crl no 619 of 2002 others page 47 of 54 approach the said agencies instead of knocking the doors of different authorities iii for more effective implementation of the juvenile justice care and protection of children act 2000 and delhi commission for women act following directions are issued labour department will register all placement agencies the registration process will be within finite period of time failure to register within that prescribed time should invite penal action which can be prescribed by this court the registration process should not only be for agencies located in delhi but also for all the agencies who are placing women and children in homes located in delhi this suggestion is made in view of the apprehension expressed during discussions with the labour department that as soon stringent laws are brought into effect in delhi the agencies may shift out to the ncr region the registration information should require 1 details of the agencies wp crl no 619 of 2002 others page 48 of 54 2 number of persons who are employed through the agencies their names ages and their addresses 3 details of salaries fixed for each person 4 addresses of the employers 5

commission for women during the discussions the labour department had indicated that the information would be put up on the website till such time the information should not be put up on the website the records may be made available by the labour department to the commission and the committee 38 various suggestions given by the petitioner in p crl no 619 of 2002 and to take such remedial steps

persons between the ages 14 and 18 are employed long hours of work lack of basic facilities including medical care and food powers of the committee commission a committee and the commission will have powers to summon the placement agencies or the employer as the case may be on complaint made by the domestic worker or her guardian or any person employing her direct payment of wages as per agreed terms and in appropriate cases impose fines direct payment of compensation in cases where severe injuries are caused to the domestic worker during the course of the work direct medical assistance wp crl no 619 of 2002 others page 51 of 54 direct the placement agency to comply with the agreement with the employer or return the commission where the terms are not complies with impose fines on the

the committee commission in cases where the domestic worker is missing within 24 hours in cases where domestic worker has been placed in home against her wishes enable her to leave her employment and direct the agency to return the commission paid by the employer back to the employer 39 the petitioner in p crl no 879 of 2007 has referred to police circular issued by dcp headquarters new delhi this circular requires the delhi police to regulate the functioning of placement agencies to ensure proper screening of domestic workers being recruited by placement agencies by maintaining the register of all such agencies ensure that the agencies enroll applicants on the basis of formal applications containing full details including the wp crl no 619 of 2002 others page 52 of 54 photographs and contact addresses of the applicants the details of previous employers etc verification of domestic workers is to be done by the police the dcp has filed the response wherein it is stated that the matter was examined in detail and the guidelines stated in the circular cannot be implemented as delhi police is already too overburdened with the law and order security inquiries and investigations etc it is also mentioned that to keep check on the maintenance of registers etc of the placement agencies would not be feasible in the current scenario of heightened security concern it is stated that the circular is merely an executive instruction and non compliance thereof cannot entail any penal consequence on the placement agencies we are of the opinion that once such circular is issued it does not behove delhi police now to wriggle out of that on the pretext that this was for internal instructions and thereby refusing to adhere to the same we therefore direct that the administration at the highest level in delhi police shall reconsider the feasibility of implementation of the instructions contained in the said 40 another direction which is sought by this petitioner pertains the dues of 83 domestic workers which are yet to be recovered from the placement agencies or the employers it is submitted that since the children were exploited without police or labour department acting to protect them the government of nct delhi wp crl no 619 of 2002 others page 53 of 54 be directed to pay the entire dues at the earliest and recover the same from the placement agencies or employers however such directions cannot be issued without dealing with this issue at length that too on the basis of proper pleadings therefore we give liberty to the petitioner to file appropriate writ in this behalf 41 the petitioner has also pointed out that 12 children are still missing and have not been recovered we direct the police to register the i in all these cases of remaining persons and take proper investigation into the matter and also take steps to locate those children at the earliest during the investigation help of the petitioner can also be sought it would be more appropriate if the interrogation of concerned persons in the placement agencies is done in the presence of the petitioner 42 these writ petitions are disposed of in the aforesaid terms however if any clarification for further consequential directions is needed the petitioners are given liberty to approach this court by means of miscellaneous applications in these writ petitions k sikri judge ajit

and female feticide the pervasiveness of this preference is reflected through the census data on the skewed sex ratio in india starting from the 1901 census which recorded 972 females per 1000 males there was an overall decline to 941 females in 1961 and 930 females in 1971 going further down to 927 females in 1991 records of lok sabha discussions on the pre natal diagnostic techniques regulation and prevention of misuse bill 1991 reflect various members concern with this alarming state of affairs which acted as clarion call to the passage of the pc pndt b d f h 318 supreme court reports 2021 2 c a act see lok sabha debates tenth series vol xxxiii no 2 july 26 1994 eleventh session at pages 506 544 the prevalence of pre natal sex selection and feticide has also attracted international censure and provoked calls for strict regulation in september 1995 the un 4th world conference on women adopted the beijing declaration and platform for action which inter alia declared female feticide and pre natal sex selection as forms of violence against women see beijing declaration and platform for action adopted in 16th plenary meeting of un 4th world conference on women 15th september 1995 article 115 while the sex ratio has improved since after the passage of the pc pndt act rising to 933 as per the 2001 census and then to 943 in the 2011 census these pernicious practices still remain rampant as per the reply filed by the then minister of state health and family welfare in the rajya sabha on 27 3 2018 as of december 2017 around 3 986 court cases had been filed under the act resulting in only 449 convictions and 136 cases of suspension of medical licenses the unrelenting continuation of this immoral practice the globally shared understanding that it constitutes form of violence against women and its potential to damage the very fabric of gender equality and dignity that forms the bedrock of our constitution are all factors that categorically establish pre natal sex determination as grave offence with serious consequences for the society as whole 5 we may also refer with benefit to the observations of this court in voluntary health association of india state of punjab 2013 4 scc 1 as follows 6 above statistics is an indication that the provisions of the act are not properly and effectively being implemented there has been no effective supervision or follow up action so as to achieve the object and purpose of the act mushrooming of various sonography centres genetic clinics genetic counselling centres genetic laboratories ultrasonic clinics imaging centres in almost all parts of the country calls for more vigil and attention by the authorities under the act but unfortunately their functioning is not being properly monitored or supervised by the authorities under the act or to find out whether c e g rekha sengar state of madhya pradesh mohan shantanagoudar 319 they are misusing the pre natal diagnostic techniques for determination of sex of foetus leading to foeticide 7 seldom the ultrasound machines used for such sex determination in violation of the provisions of the act are seized and even if seized they are being released to the violators of the law only to repeat the crime hardly few cases end in conviction the cases booked under the act are pending disposal for several years in many courts in the country and nobody takes any interest in their disposal and hence seldom those cases end in conviction and sentences fact well known to the violators of law in the present case contrary to the prevailing practice the investigative team has seized the sonography machine and made out strong prima facie case against the petitioner therefore we find it imperative that no leniency should be granted at this stage as the same may reinforce the notion that the pc pndt act is only paper tiger and that clinics and laboratories can carry out sex determination and feticide with impunity strict approach has to be adopted if we are to eliminate the scourge of female feticide and iniquity towards girl children from our society though it certainly remains open to the petitioner to disprove the merits of these allegations at the stage of trial 6 the fact that on 13 10 2020 the co accused in the present case was released on bail by the high court in mcrc no 39380 2020 does not alter our conclusions the allegations in the fir and the charge sheet as well the disclosure statements made by the petitioner and the co accused under section 27 of the indian evidence act 1872 reveal that prima facie the petitioner had more active role in conducting the alleged illegal medical practices of sex determination and sex selective abortion whereas the alleged role of the co accused was limited to merely picking up and dropping off the petitioner clients hence we find no grounds for granting parity with the co accused to the petitioner 7 thus in view of the presence of prima facie evidence against the petitioner and other factors as referred to supra we find ourselves compelled to uphold the impugned order of the high court denying bail to the petitioner however in light of this court directions in voluntary health association of india supra mandating speedy disposal of such cases it is open for the petitioner to request the trial court to expedite her trial and decide it within period of 1 year c e g 320 supreme court reports 2021 2 c 8 we make it clear that the above observations on facts are made only to decide the present petition any of the observations made on facts will not come in the way of the trial court to complete the trial and decide the matter the matter shall be decided by the trial court on its own merits based on facts the special leave petition is dismissed accordingly divya pandey petition dismissed b d f h '], ['976 supreme court reports 2020 1 c 976 2020 1 c a c e g national commission for protection of child rights ors dr rajesh kumar ors civil appeal no 7968 of 2019 january 13 2020 deepak gupta and aniruddha bose jj commissions for protection of child rights act 2005 furnishing of information by the police official there were news reports in february 2017 indicating that child care institution in west bengal had indulged in large scale trafficking of children ncpcr took cognizance of these reports on 03 03 2017 and two members of the ncpcr went to the state and requested the state officials to provide them some information which according to the ncpcr was not provided adgp cid was summoned to appear before the ncpcr adgp filed writ petition challenging the jurisdiction of the ncpcr to summon him the high court stayed the direction of the ncpcr mainly on the ground that since the state commission had taken cognizance of the matter on 24 02 2017 the ncpcr had prima facie no jurisdiction on appeal held if any official is asked for information by any of the commissions he is duty bound to reply to the letters of the commissions one commission may raise the issue that since it is seized of the matter and is inquiring into it the national commission should not start another inquiry but it is not for the officials to raise such an issue whether an inquiry has actually been initiated or not cannot be decided by an official this has to be decided either by the commission or by court of law therefore adgp should have furnished the information to the ncpcr rather than challenging the jurisdiction of the ncpcr commissions for protection of child rights act 2005 13 2 whether 13 2 of the cpcr act places the two commissions the ncpcr and the state commission in water tight compartments where they oust the jurisdiction of each other held there is no question of ouster of jurisdiction of any commission 976 national commission for protection of child rights dr rajesh kumar 977 the only constraint placed by 13 2 is that if the state commission has already started an inquiry the national commission should naturally refrain from inquiring into the matter this however does not mean that the national commission cannot go into the other larger questions which may have led to the specific incidents of violation of child rights which need to be inquired into insofar the inter state or international ramifications g child is being illegally sent for adoption abroad here again if the state commission in such case asks for assistance from the national commission or some other state commission where the child may have been illegally trafficked the national commission or the other state commission should cooperate with the commission inquiring into the matter both the commissions have to work for the best interest of the children in spirit of cooperation partly disposing of the appeal the court held 1 the following three questions arise for decision in this case whether the matter in hand was pending before the west bengal commission for protection of child rights before the ncpcr took cognizance on 03 03 2017 and started inquiry on 07 03 2017 ii whether section 13 2 of the cpcr act places the two commissions the ncpcr and the state commissions in water tight compartments where they oust the jurisdiction of each other iii whether in case which has inter state or international ramifications the jurisdiction if any of the ncpcr can be ousted para 11 985 d 2 as far as the aforementioned questions framed are concerned this court answers the question no 1 by holding that in the facts of the present case the wbcpcr had not started an inquiry till 07 03 2017 as far as question no 2 is concerned this court is of the view that there is no question of ouster of jurisdiction of any commission the only constraint placed by section 13 2 is that if the state commission has already started an inquiry the national commission should naturally refrain from b d f h 978 supreme court reports 2020 1 c inquiring into the matter this however does not mean that the national commission cannot go into the other larger questions which may have led to the specific incidents of violation of child rights which need to be inquired into with regard to question no 3 this court holds that even state commission has the power to inquire into those matters which fall within its purview and even if the illegality is such that it has inter state or international ramifications g child is being illegally sent for adoption abroad here again this court is of the view that if the state commission in such case asks for assistance from the national commission or some other state commission where the child may have been illegally trafficked the national commission or the other state commission should cooperate with the commission inquiring into the matter para 36 1000 f 3 as clearly held both the commissions have to work for the best interest of the children in spirit of cooperation unfortunately in this case there has been no cooperation rather mudslinging at each other this court would like to reiterate and re emphasise that there are no jurisdictional issues involved para 37 1000 h 4 police officials should realise that when the commissions constituted under the cpcr act ask for some relevant information they must respectfully reply to the same and not rake up the dispute of so called jurisdiction even the police officials must realise that these commissions have been constituted for the welfare of the children even assuming that the wbcpcr had started an inquiry there is no reason why adgp cid could not have provided the information to the ncpcr it was not for him to question the jurisdiction of the ncpcr if any official is asked for information by any of the commissions he is duty bound to reply to the letters of the commission one commission may raise the issue that since it is seized of the matter and is inquiring into it the national commission should not start another inquiry but it is not for the officials to raise such an issue whether an inquiry has actually been initiated or not cannot be decided by an official this has to be decided either by the commission or by court of law b d f h national commission for protection of child rights dr rajesh kumar 979 therefore in view of this court adgp cid would have been better advised to furnish information to the ncpcr rather than challenging the jurisdiction of the ncpcr para 33 999 e 5 in view of the above this court is clearly of the view that adgp cid should have furnished the information which appears to now have been furnished by the state authorities if such information has not been furnished the present incumbent holding the post of adgp cid west bengal is directed to furnish the information to the national commission as well as to juvenile justice committee of the high court of calcutta within 15 days from the date of receipt of certified copy of this judgment the counsel for the state of west bengal shall inform the present additional director general of police

1 it so sad we start with lament because institutions set up to protect children have virtually forsaken them in fight over their so called jurisdictions 2 india is signatory to the united nations convention on the rights of the child 1989 which makes it obligatory upon the signatory states to take all necessary steps to protect the rights of the children as set out in the convention the government of india enacted the juvenile justice care and protection of children act 2000 this was repealed by the juvenile justice care and protection of children act 2015 hereinafter referred to as the jj act national commission for protection of child rights dr rajesh kumar deepak gupta 981 3 it was felt expedient to enact law constituting special commissions to protect the rights of children parliament enacted the commissions for protection of child rights act 2005 hereinafter referred to as the cpcr act the cpcr act envisages the constitution of national commission for protection of child rights hereinafter referred to as ncpcr national commission under section 3 and the state commissions for protection of child rights hereinafter referred to as state commissions under section 17 we shall deal with their respective functions and powers at later stage but there can be no manner of doubt that these two commissions one at the national level and the other at the state level are expected to function in spirit of cooperation we expect such commissions to consult discuss and cooperate with each other while exercising their powers and fulfilling the duties enjoined upon them by the cpcr act these two institutions are in the nature of siblings the goal which they both set out to achieve is the same viz protecting children from all sorts of abuse exploitation etc we see no reason why there should be any disharmony and lack of coordination between these two institutions this non cooperation and lack of coordination can only occur when the persons manning the institutions put their own interests over the interest of the children it is only when those in charge of such commissions give themselves so much importance that they forget that they are the creation of statute the only purpose of which is to protect children 4 this case is classic example where in the fight between the state commission and the national commission the children have been all but forgotten we are sorry that this court has to spend its time resolving such disputes this court as well as the two major parties litigating before us definitely have better things to do 5 from the material on record it appears that news reports were published some time in february 2017 indicating that child care institution based in jalpaiguri in west bengal had indulged in large scale trafficking of children the ncpcr took cognizance of these reports on 03 03 2017 and two members of the ncpcr went to jalpaiguri on 07 03 2017 they requested the state officials to provide them some information which according to the ncpcr was not provided they finally summoned the additional director general of police adgp criminal investigation department cid west bengal respondent no 1 herein to appear before the ncpcr this gentleman instead of b d f h 982 supreme court reports 2020 1 c appearing before the ncpcr chose to file writ petition challenging the jurisdiction of the ncpcr to summon him the high court by the impugned order dated 29 08 2017 stayed the direction of the ncpcr mainly on the ground that since the state commission had taken cognizance of the matter on 24 02 2017 the ncpcr had prima facie no jurisdiction 6 section 13 of the cpcr act deals with the functionsand powers of the national commission section 24 of the cpcr act vests the same functions and powers in the state commissions section 13 of the cpcr act therefore defines the functions and powers of both the ncpcr and the state commissions it reads as follows 13 functions of commission 1 the commission shall perform all or any of the following functions namely examine and review the safeguards provided by or under any law for the time being in force for the protection of child rights and recommend measures for their effective implementation present to the central government annually and at such other intervals as the commission may deem fit reports upon the working of those safeguards inquire into violation of child rights and recommend initiation of proceedings in such cases examine all factors that inhibit the enjoyment of rights of children affected by terrorism communal violence riots natural disaster domestic violence hiv aids trafficking maltreatment torture and exploitation pornography and prostitution and recommend appropriate remedial measures look into the matters relating to children in need of special care and protection including children in distress marginalized and disadvantaged children children in conflict with law juveniles children without family and children of prisoners and recommend appropriate remedial measures study treaties and other international instruments and undertake periodical review of existing policies programmes and other activities on child rights and make recommendations for their effective implementation in the best interest of children b d f h national commission for protection of child rights dr rajesh kumar deepak gupta 983 undertake and promote research in the field of child rights h spread child rights literacy among various sections of the society and promote awareness of the safeguards available for protection of these rights through publications the media seminars and other available means inspect or cause to be inspected any juvenile custodial home or any other place of residence or institution meant for children under the control of the central government or any state government or any other authority including any institution run by social organisation where children are detained or lodged for the purpose of treatment reformation or protection and take up with these authorities for remedial action if found necessary inquire into complaints and take suo motu notice of matters relating to deprivation and violation of child rights ii non implementation of laws providing for protection and development of children iii non compliance of policy decisions guidelines or instructions aimed at mitigating hardships to and ensuring welfare of the children and to provide relief to such children or take up the issues arising out of such matters with appropriate authorities and such other functions as it may consider necessary for the promotion of child rights and any other matter incidental to the above functions 2 the commission shall not inquire into any matter which is pending before state commission or any other commission duly constituted under any law for the time being in force 7 perusal of section 13 makes it amply clear that the national commission and the state commissions have been clothed with identical powers and functions the commissions have been constituted with view to not only protect the rights of children but also to suggest ways and means of enhancing the rights of children and ensuring that laws made for the protection of children are effectively implemented these c e g 984 supreme court reports 2020 1 c a c e g commissions exercise extremely important powers they must function only for the protection and betterment of children these commissions cannot become sources of power self aggrandisement or means of obtaining the trappings of power like official cars bungalows etc the people who are appointed to such commissions must in true sense be friends of the children willing to spend their time and energy to help children rather than pushing their own personal or political interest 8 amongst many others the main functions and powers which commission is required to perform are examining and reviewing the legal provisions enacted for protection of children so that they are effectively implemented inquire into cases of violation of rights of children and recommend the initiation of proceedings in such cases examining the factors which inhibit the enjoyment of rights by children in circumstances mentioned in section 13 and recommend remedial measures taking deeper look into matters relating to children in need of care and protection children in distress children belonging to marginalised and disadvantaged sections children in conflict of law children without family or children of prisoners to study various international instruments treaties and policies undertake research in the field of child rights spread awareness about child rights increase child literacy etc section 13 1 empowers the commission to itself inspect or cause to be inspected any juvenile custodial home or any other place of residence or institutionmeant for children whether such institution is run by the state government or the central government or any other authority and includes institutions run by social organisations which in our opinion would include ngos also the commissions can take up all other necessary functions and are required to present to the central government state government as the case may be reports in these regards 9 in the present case we are mainly concerned with the functions of the commission referred to in clause of sub section 1 of section 13 of the cpcr act which empowers the commissions to inquire into complaints or even take suo motu notice of matters relating to deprivation and violation of child rights non implementation of laws providing for protection and development of children non compliance of policies and guidelines framed for the purpose of ameliorating and protecting the conditions of children etc there can be no manner of doubt that giving children in adoption without following the prescribed procedure or guidelines would definitely be matter which could be inquired into both by the ncpcr or the state commission national commission for protection of child rights dr rajesh kumar deepak gupta 985 10 we are in this case mainly concerned with section 13 2 of the cpcr act which states that the national commission shall not inquire into any matter which is pending before state commission or any other commission duly constituted under any law for the time being in force 11 the following three questions arise for decision in this case whether the matter in hand was pending before the west bengal commission for protection of child rights before the ncpcr took cognizance on 03 03 2017 and started inquiry on 07 03 2017 ii whether section 13 2 of the cpcr act places the two commissions the ncpcr and the state commissions in water tight compartments where they oust the jurisdiction of each other iii whether in case which has inter state or international ramifications the jurisdiction if any of the ncpcr can be ousted 12 we may clarify that we have used the term jurisdiction because it has been used by the parties however the proper word should not be jurisdiction but the functions and powers to be exercised by the respective commissions in our view if we do not refer to the jurisdictions and deal with the functions and powers of the commissions then matters become much simpler there is no ouster of jurisdiction like in the case of courts the purpose of section 13 2 is to ensure that one commission carries out the inquiry the language of the cpcr act is clear that if the state commission or any other commission constituted under law has started an inquiry under section 14 then the national commission should stay its hands in the matter both the commissions have similar powers and functions the jurisdiction of the state commissions is limited to the state for which such commission is constituted whereas the national commission has jurisdiction all over the country and can inquire into any matter in any state we have no doubt in our mind that both the commissions are expected to function in spirit of comity and in concert with each other and not as adversaries the main issue which arises in this case is whether the west bengal commission for protection of child rights wbcpcr had actually started the inquiry into the matter before the ncpcr started its inquiry b d f h 986 supreme court reports 2020 1 c a c e g 13 section 13 1 empowers the state commissions to inquire into the violation of child rights in advanced law lexicon1 the word inquire has been defined as follows inquire to seek knowledge by putting question to ask to make investigation or inquisition in the context in which the word inquire occurs in section 13 1 it obviously means something more than just making request for information it envisages the commission playing an active role in ascertaining the facts relating to the three circumstances dealt with in this provision it is more than just sending letter it is more akin to preliminary inquiry and if such inquiry indicates that the rights of the children have been violated or the laws have not been implemented or the policy decisions or guidelines have been violated then the commission must also suggest remedial measures this power to inquire under section 13 1 will also have to be read with the power under section 13 1 which includes the power to inquire into the violation of child rights and recommend initiation of proceedings in such cases reading these two clauses together it is obvious to us that inquire is not making note on the file but something more we are dealing with children who cannot complain the commissions are meant to protect children who have no voice it is these commissions who have to give voice and feelings to the distress calls of children the commission can thereafter take action by itself if permitted under law or can recommend initiation of proceedings in accordance with law 14 it would be apposite to refer to sections 14 and 15 of the cpcr act which apply both to the national commission and the state commissions the same read as follows 14 powers relating to inquiries 1 the commission shall while inquiring into any matter referred to in clause of sub section 1 of section 13 have all the powers of civil court trying suit under the code of civil procedure 1908 5 of 1908 and in particular in respect of the following matters namely summoning and enforcing the attendance of any person and examining him on oath discovery and production of any document 13rd edition 2005 ramanatha aiyar pg 2358 national commission for protection of child rights dr rajesh kumar deepak gupta 987 receiving evidence on affidavits requisitioning any public record or copy thereof from any court or office and issuing commissions for the examination of witnesses or documents 2 the commission shall have the power to forward any case to magistrate having jurisdiction to try the same and the magistrate to whom any such case is forwarded shall proceed to hear the complaint against the accused as if the case has been forwarded to him under section 346 of the code of criminal procedure 1973 2 of 1974 15 steps after inquiry the commission may take any of the following steps upon the completion of an inquiry held under this act namely where the inquiry discloses the commission of violation of child rights of serious nature or contravention of provisions of any law for the time being in force it may recommend to the concerned government or authority the initiation of proceedings for prosecution or such other action as the commission may deem fit against the concerned person or persons ii iii approach the supreme court or the high court concerned for such directions orders or writs as that court may deem necessary recommend to the concerned government or authority for thegrant of such interim relief to the victim or the members of his family as the commission may consider necessary 15 any commission while conducting an inquiry under section 13 1 has been given wide powers akin to that of civil court and has right to forward any case to magistrate and the magistrate is required to deal with such case forwarded to him as if the case has been forwarded to him under section 346 of the code of criminal procedure 1973 the follow up action which commission can take is also clearly set out in section 15 of the cpcr act which empowers the commission to make recommendations to the concerned government or authority for initiation of proceedings including prosecution or such other action as the commission may deem fit this is recommendatory power but b d f h 988 supreme court reports 2020 1 c a c e g normally we would expect that the government would accept the recommendation of the commission in this regard the second power given to the commission is to approach the supreme court or the high court for an appropriate writ order or direction the commission can also recommend the grant of interim relief to victim under section 15 iii of the cpcr act the aforesaid provisions which set out the powers relating to inquiries and steps to be taken thereafter clearly indicate that the inquiry contemplated is more than only gathering of information and is more in the nature of an investigation or inquisition 16 in the present case the dispute is who started inquiry first whether it was the wbcpcr or the national commission as far as the national commission is concerned there is no dispute that it started its inquiry on 07 03 2017 when its members visited jalpaiguri to inquire into the matter the stand of the national commission is that they were for the first time informed on 24 07 2017that the state commission has taken cognizance and is inquiring into the matter even though they had written various letters to the various officials including the district magistrate and the police officials in this regard from the list of dates filed by the wbcpcr it appears that on12 07 2016 the director child rights and trafficking west bengal for short the director crt wrote to the district magistrate jalpaiguri seeking report on the illegal child trafficking there an inquiry team was formed by the district magistrate jalpaiguri on 09 12 2016 and report was sent to the director crt on 11 01 2017 thereafter the director crt passed an order that the specialised adoption agency for short the saa jalpaiguri is not functioning as per the provisions of adoption guidelines 2015 and the jj act and 15 children from the saa jalpaiguri run by the north bengal peoples development centre for short the nbpdc were transferred to other institutions on 17 01 2017 the central adoption resource authority for short the cara filed complaint with the cid west bengal on 22 01 2017 report appeared in local newspaper about this child trafficking racket on 15 02 2017 team was constituted by the cid west bengal to investigate the complaint made by the cara on 16 02 2017 team of cid west bengal went to jalpaiguri on 17 02 2017 letter was allegedly sent by the chairperson of the wbcpcr to the district magistrate jalpaiguri informing that the state commission had taken cognizance of the report published in the daily newspaper on 22 01 2017 on 19 02 2017 formal first information report fir was registered in the matter the report dated 11 01 2017 referred to national commission for protection of child rights dr rajesh kumar deepak gupta 989 above was sent to the wbcpcr on 24 02 2017 thereafter news items again appeared on 26 02 2017 and two women officials of the concerned adoption centre were arrested admittedly ncpcr took note of this instance on 03 03 2017 and on 07 03 2017 two members of the ncpcr visited jalpaiguri to conduct an inquiry 17 we had requested learned counsel appearing for the wbcpcr to provide the file of wbcpcr in relation to this matter which was provided after going through the file all that we can say isthat the file is not maintained like an official file the papers were kept casually except for the noting sheet the other papers were not tagged the other papers were also not paginated in such file there can be additions and alterations at any stage we therefore cannot place too much reliance on such poorly maintained file and direct the wbcpcr to ensure that in future files especially of complaints are maintained in proper manner according to the documents which form part of this file the wbcpcr took suo motu cognizance of the incident on 30 01 2017 on the basis of the newspapersreport dated 22 01 2017 it was stated in the noting sheet that the matter be put up for appropriate action though this note is dated 30 01 2017and was put up to the chairperson wbcpcr it appears that the chairperson wrote that she should be reminded after 10 days for follow up action the file was again put up before the chairperson on 13 02 2017 on 14 02 2017 it was ordered that the district magistrate district children protection officer dcpo may be asked to submit report draft letter was put up which was approved on 16 02 2017 and dispatched on 17 02 2017 the dcpo jalpaiguri sent the report through mail dated 24 02 2017 the matter was again placed before the chairperson who directed that the report be kept for records the next noting on the file is of 15 03 2017 this note of 15 03 2017 has been put up with regard to the visit of the chairperson and secretary to jalpaiguri on 10 03 2017 and 11 03 2017 to assist and monitor the situation after the recent cases of child trafficking though the visit is dated 10 03 2017 and 11 03 2017 the note is put up on 15 03 2017 and approved on the same date we are unable to understand why the note for the visit was not put up prior to the visit we have perused the report prepared by the chairperson of the wbcpcr and find that the report is more in the nature of allegations against the members of the ncpcr the report virtually does not deal with the issue related to trafficking of the children we shall deal with this report at later stage b d f h 990 supreme court reports 2020 1 c a c e g 18 even if we accept the record of the wbcpcr to be the gospel truth then also other than using the word takes suo moto cognizance on 30 01 2017 the wbcpcr had taken no steps to inquire into the matter which is the mandate of section 13 1 of the cpcr act till the visit of its chairperson on 10 03 2017 and 11 03 2017 we make it clear that in every case personal visit is not required but the manner in which this case has been dealt with leaves much to be desired we see no reason why if cognizance was taken on 30 01 2017 it was directed that the matter be placed for reminding the chairperson to take follow up action after 10 days these sort of matters brook no delay even after the matter was put up no attempts were made to hold an inquiry all that was done was to order the district magistrate dcpo to submit report that report was filed on 24 02 2017 and it was ordered that the report be kept on record it appears that it is only after the visit of the members of the ncpcr that the wbcpcr actually felt it necessary to itself visit jalpaiguri and take stock of the situation 19 as pointed above as far as ncpcr is concerned on 03 03 2017 communication was sent by the ncpcr to the district magistrate jalpaiguri wherein he was asked to give specific information with regard to the home in question thereafter on 07 03 2017 two members of the ncpcr visited jalpaiguri and even if the inquiry did not start on 03 03 2017 it definitely started on 07 03 2017 it found various deficiencies especially with regard to non constitution of child welfare committee cwc in new jalpaiguri district from 23 08 2013 28 08 2015 it also found that ad hoc cwc was functioning which is against the provisions of law therefore the ncpcr sent letter on 16 03 2017 to the district magistrate jalpaiguri seeking status of registration of homes status of cwcs etc on 23 03 2017 the ncpcr sent another letter to the district magistrate specifically asking whether the wbcpcr had commenced an inquiry into the matter before the visit of the members of the ncpcr or after the initiation of the inquiry by the ncpcr to this no reply was given by the district magistrate then the ncpcr summoned the district magistrate jalpaiguri on 12 04 2017 for personal appearance on 25 04 2017 the district magistrate did not appear but sent some information vide communication dated 21 04 2017 however in this communication also there is no reply to the specific query as to whether the wbcpcr had initiated an inquiry into the matter the ncpcr also took no steps for almost two months on 20 06 2017 the ncpcr sought the following information from the adgp cid west bengal respondent no 1 national commission for protection of child rights dr rajesh kumar deepak gupta 991 1 2 in this case sale of as many as about 17 children has been mentioned in this case in which children were sold both in the country and abroad since this organization has come in existence how many children have been adopted through this organization provide list of those to the commission in this case children were given to non resident indian and foreign couples both hence this case seems to be case of international trafficking record concerning as to how many children have been given to non resident and foreign coupes be made available to the commission 3 according to newspaper forged papers and papers of national adoption authority have been used in this crime in forged manner copies of papers seized by cid statement list copies of evidence be made available to the commission 4 5 list of all the detained arrested people in this case copy of first information report copies of all the investigation reports be provided to the commission copy of the statement of detained people from the year 2013 to 2015 child welfare committee had not been constituted in district jalpaiguri in place thereof ad hoc committee had been working the following mentioned papers documents relating to this committee be made available to the commission copy of order for constituting ad hoc committee ii people included in the ad hoc committee list of those with their names posts designations be made available to the commission iii minutes of the meetings convened by ad hoc committee during its tenure iv decisions about how many children were taken by ad hoc committee copies of all the case files concerning with all those if any charge sheet has been filed in court then copy thereof 20 on the same day e 20 06 2017 the district magistrate jalpaiguri was also directed by the ncpcr to give information pertaining to the constitution of ad hoc committee and members of the ad hoc b d f h 992 supreme court reports 2020 1 c a c e g committee that very day another communication was sent by the ncpcr to the department of women child development west bengal to initiate an inquiry into the matterand inform the ncpcr about the report of the government according to the ncpcr no response was received from any of the authorities thereafter another reminder was sent on 13 07 2017 left with no option on 20 07 2017 summons were issued to the adgp cid west bengal to appear before the ncpcr in person on 25 07 2017 along with relevant documents communication was also sent to the chief secretary west bengal on 22 07 2017 asking for information the adgp cid west bengal by letter fax on 24 07 2017 informed the ncpcr that since wbcpcr has already proceeded with the matter the ncpcr should stay its hand in the present matter meanwhile on 21 07 2017 report was sent by the cid west bengal supplying some information but most of the information was not sent thereafter the ncpcr issued summons to the adgp cid west bengal on 14 08 2017 to appear before the ncpcr on 29 08 2017 the adgp cid west bengal challenged these summons by filing writ petition in the calcutta high court the advocate general of the state appeared for dr rajesh kumar adgp cid west bengal the high court vide impugned order prima facie came to the conclusion that since the wbcpcr had taken cognizance of the matter on 24 02 2017 the ncpcr is denuded of its jurisdiction over the subject the high court accordingly stayed the summons 21 we are constrained to observe that in this clash of egos between the state commission wbcpcr and the national commission ncpcr for this entire period other than the police taking action nothing was done on the administrative side to set matters right 22 the police have acted case has been filed accused have been arrested and we are told that most of the children have been reunited with their parents we are purposely not commenting on the criminal aspects of the matter we refrain from doing so because any comment from us may affect the trial of the accused who are entitled to fair and free trial in fact since criminal proceedings in respect to the illegal adoptions had already started no inquiry could actually be conducted by either of the two commissions with respect to the same however the national commission was definitely entitled to inquire as to why proper cwcs had not been constituted and under what orders were ad hoc cwcs functioning the commissions can also inquire into the factual aspects which led to the trafficking of the children though not the actual national commission for protection of child rights dr rajesh kumar deepak gupta 993 crime itself in fact we are of the view that such inquiries are necessary so that such events do not occur in the future in case the cwcs had been properly constituted may be this unfortunate situation would not have arisen 23 though we are of the view that an inquiry into the alleged illegal adoption could not be conducted because criminal case had already been registered at the same time we cannot shut our eyes to the manner in which both the state commission wbcpcr the national commission ncpcr and the senior officials of the state cid have dealt with the matter we have already commented on the lack of alacrity on the part of the wbcpcr which purportedly took cognizance of the matter on 30 01 2017 but no effective steps were taken to inquire into the matter till 10 03 2017 except calling for report the members of the ncpcr visited jalpaiguri on 07 03 2017 and have recorded the statement of cwc members according to the statements so recorded one of the accused who was secretary of the nbpdc which was running the concerned saa prayed for certificates for 20 children to be declared legally fit for adoption whom they placed before prospective adoptive parents paps without legally fit for adoption lfa certificatesfrom cwc jalpaiguri according to the statements the members of the cwc were shocked that the legal procedure had not been followed according to these members they complained to the various officials but they were compelled to give certificates that the children were legally fit for adoption in the absence of the parties who have made the statements we would not like to make any further comment except to state that if any member of cwc can be compelled or pressurized to give such certificate then that member has no business of ever being appointed as member of cwc or in any capacity in child rights institution 24 we however find that in the report of the chairperson wbcpcr she herself mentioned that they had visited the home and inspected the premises but nothing more is written as to the manner in which the children were trafficked rest of the report deals with alleged misconduct of the members of the ncpcr when they visited the home at korak it is alleged that the superintendent of the home complained that the ncpcr team had brought entire media including the television media inside the centre and despite protest of the superintendent the media was brought inside the home again the chairperson mentions b d f h 994 supreme court reports 2020 1 c a c e g that the district magistrate also complained that the team of the ncpcr had brought media everywhere and had insulted everyone however we did not find anything of this sort mentioned in the communication sent by the district magistrate be that as it may we find that the report of the chairperson wbcpcr does not deal at all with the issue of child trafficking 25 we would like to make it clear that when arguments were taking place the report of the chairperson wbcpcr was not brought to our knowledge and we only saw it in the file therefore we cannot rely on the report of the chairperson wbcpcr especially since we have not given the ncpcr right to rebut what is stated in this report however even if all aspects are not correct but only one aspect of taking the media inside the home is correct we have to express our displeasure with the same we would like to make it clear that no person including members of the commissions whether it be the national commission or the state commission are permitted to take media with them when they visit any of the homes set up under the jj act or under any other law the privacy of the children is of the highest importance in this fight between two bodies the children cannot be madesubject matter of media war we sincerely hope that nothing like this will happen in future 26 coming to the role of the national commission we somehow feel that the national commission was also more interested in settling scores with the state commission or with the officials of the state government rather than ameliorating the plight of the children on 03 03 2017 the following information was asked by the ncpcr from the district magistrate 1 whether this home was registered copy of the registration of the organization list of officers and employees of the organization be provided to the commission 2 whether this home had been registered from central adoption authority whatever papers relating to registration in cara are available be made available to the commission 3 whether this organization had been working as district adoption authority papers relating to registration in the women child development department west bengal be made available to the commission national commission for protection of child rights dr rajesh kumar deepak gupta 995 4 5 6 if this organization has been run under section 41 juvenile justice care protection of children act 2015 registered specific adoption agency recognized by central adoption resources authority state adoption resources tribunal concerning papers be made available to the commission in this case sale of as many as about 17 children has been mentioned in this case in which children were sold both in the couintry8 and abroad since this organization has come in existence how many children have been adopted through this organization provide list of those to the commission in this case children were given to non resident indian and foreign coupes both hence this case seems to be case of international trafficking record concerning as to how many children have been given to non resident and foreign couples be made available to the commission 7 according to newspaper forged papers and papers of national adoption authority have been used in this crime in forged manner copies of papers seized by cid statement list copies of evidence be made available to the commission 8 list of all the detained arrested people in this case copy of first information report copies of all the investigation reports be provided to the commission 9 how many children were sent by child welfare committee cwc to the organization how many times cwc visited organization during the past five years and whatever other proceedings have been initiated relating to the organization copies of those be made available to the commission 10 reports of all the inspections conducted by the district administration in the above said organization in the past three years and copy of report of inspections conducted at the time of registration of organization be made available to the commission 11 make available list of adoption organization or organizations institutions concerning with welfare of children cci whether registered unregistered in jalpaiguri be made available to the commission b d f h 996 supreme court reports 2020 1 c a c e g 12 if any other organization institutions have remained involved in illegal acts and cases would have been registered against them list of those be made available to the commission 13 because limits of district jalpaiguri are attached with international limits of nepal and bangladesh therefore list of cases of trafficking registered in the district and list of complaints registered about missing children etc from district also be made available to the commission 27 in our opinion the district magistrate should have given the requisite information to all the aforesaid questions except question nos 7 and 8 because these related to copies of papers seized by the cid and list of all detained people in the case the commissionsunder the cpcr act have no jurisdiction to monitor criminal cases their jurisdiction does not extend to monitoring the law and order which is state subject 28 thereafter on 16 03 2017 the following information was also asked for by the ncpcr from the district magistrate 14 from the year 2013 to 2015 child welfare committee had not been constituted in district jalpaiguri in place thereof ad hoc committee had been working the following mentioned papers documents relating to this committee be made available to the commission copy of order for constituting ad hoc committee ii people included in the ad hoc committee list of those with their names posts designations be made available to the commission iii minutes of the meetings convened by ad hoc committee during its tenure iv decisions about how many children were taken by ad hoc committee copies of all the case files concerning with all those 15 during the course of inquiry it was given to understand that office of the district children protection office dcpo which is available in the premises of the collectorate itself was sealed and case has been registered against few people particulars of all those and the following mentioned information relating to those are desired national commission for protection of child rights dr rajesh kumar deepak gupta 997 people who were appointed in dcpo office in the past 10 years ii order for all the appointments iii list of all the people appointed 29 in our opinion the aforesaid information could have also been provided by the district magistrate but for reasons best known to her this information was not provided promptly on 23 03 2017 the ncpcr sent letter to the district magistrate jalpaiguri in which the district magistrate was specifically asked to answer the following query 1 whether west bengal state commission for protection of rights of children have commenced any inquiry in the above said case as to your level before approaching of commission or after commencing inquiry by the national commission for protection of rights of children if so then please provide details thereof from the record it appears that no answer was sent by the district magistrate to this query therefore the ncpcr was justified in further proceeding with the matter because it was neither informed by district magistrate or the wbcpcr that the wbcpcr had already started inquiry into the matter it was only after summons were issued to the district magistrate on 12 04 2017 that she sent some documents however with regard to large number of documents it was stated that since the concerned dcpo has been arrested and the documents were in her custody the requisite papers were not traceable with regard to some of the documents it was mentioned that the cid west bengal may be contacted because those documents are with the police in connection with the criminal case 30 it was thereafter that communication was sent on 20 06 2017 to dr rajesh kumar ips adgp cid west bengal by the ncpcr this was the first letter sent to police official in this letter certain information quoted hereinabove was called for dr rajesh kumar adgp cid west bengal did not provide the aforesaid information and thereafter on 13 07 2017 reminder was sent to him similar reminder was sent to the district magistrate also thereafter on 20 07 2017 summons were issued to dr rajesh kumar as mentioned earlier dr rajesh kumar sent letter fax on 24 07 2017 mentioning that the wbcpcr had taken cognizance of the matter and therefore the ncpcr is barred from c e g 998 supreme court reports 2020 1 c taking up the inquiry reply was sent on 24 07 2017 informing him that if he did not appear before the national commission action against him will be taken under section 166a of the indian penal code 1860 thereafter dr rajesh kumar sent detailed reply challenging the authority of the national commission to summon him and also taking exception to the language used in the letter we fail to understand why this police official took such step we may mention that he has not been served despite various attempts by this court it appears to us that he does not want to appear before us on one pretext or the other we are constrained to observe that from perusal of the documents on record it is apparent that he did not cooperate with the national commission the answer given by the state cid to the ncpcris that the documents are lying with the court we are sure that senior ips official of the level of dr rajesh kumar must be aware that copies of all documents are also kept by the police before filing them in court why could these documents not be provided to the national commission at least those documents that had nothing to do with the criminal aspect of the case but dealt with formation of the ad hoc committees and the absence of properly constituted cwc could have been provided 31 with regard to the letter dated 03 03 2017 we have already indicated that all the information except that relating to question nos 7 and 8 should have been provided by the district magistrate in fact even with regard to question nos 7 and 8 even if the copies of the papers seized and copies of the statements recorded were not to be provided there was no problem in providing the list of the detained persons and copy of the fir as far as the second letter dated 16 03 2017 is concerned again we find no reason why the information could not be provided but since the district magistrate had responded that some of the information was not available as it was handed over to the state cid we would have expected that the adgp cid west bengal should have provided the necessary information to the ncpcr except that which related only to the investigation of the criminal case in our view neither the national commission nor the state commission had jurisdiction to investigate the criminal matter and they cannot ask for copies of the statements recorded by the investigating authorities that can only be matter between the prosecution and the accused 32 having said so we are clearly of the view that dr rajesh kumar was obviously not cooperating with the ncpcr for reasons b d f h national commission for protection of child rights dr rajesh kumar deepak gupta 999 best known to him in our view the state commission had not started any inquiry into the illegal setting up of cwcs or the alleged ad hoc cwc being constituted in violation of the laws we see no reason why dr rajesh kumar has not responded to the letter of the ncpcr clearly providing the information indicated above his reply that the documents had been filed in court is obviously an evasive answer we are constrained to make observations against dr rajesh kumar even though he is not present before us because we have no doubt in our mind that he is evading accepting notices sent from this court 33 police officials should realise that when the commissions constituted under the cpcr act ask for some relevant information they must respectfully reply to the same and not rake up the dispute of so called jurisdiction even the police officials must realise that these commissions have been constituted for the welfare of the children even assuming that the wbcpcr hadstarted an inquiry we see no reason why dr rajesh kumar could not have provided the information to the ncpcr it was not for him to question the jurisdiction of the ncpcr if any official is asked for information by any of the commissions he is duty bound to reply to the letters of the commission one commission may raise the issue that since it is seized of the matter and is inquiring into it the national commission should not start another inquiry but it is not for the officials to raise such an issue whether an inquiry has actually been initiated or not cannot be decided by an official this has to be decided either by the commission or by court of law therefore in our view dr rajesh kumar would have been better advised to furnish information to the ncpcr rather than challenging the jurisdiction of the ncpcr 34 having held so we are clearly of the view that even the language of the letters sent by the ncpcr to dr rajesh kumar was unnecessarily harsh we are not repeating the contents of the letters but according to us when commission asks for information the letter should be formulated like request and not like an order even if there is non compliance of such request the commission should send another letter in stronger terms directing the official to provide the requisite information but there is no need to threaten officials with arrest this should only be done as last resort 35 we may also note that though the national commission showed lot of urgency till the matter went up to the calcutta high court after b d f h 1000 supreme court reports 2020 1 c the matter came to this court for almost 2 years virtually nothing was done and we were orally informed that due to lack of translation of documents from bengali to hindi english the inquiry could not be completed we are of the view that if the ncpcr decides to inquire into matter then it must procure the services of translator to get the documents translated from the regional languages it cannot on the one hand take over the inquiry even if the state commission has not started the inquiry and on the other hand rely upon the authorities of the state to provide the translation we are sure that there are enough universities and colleges in delhi where bengali is taught and if the national commission really wanted to complete the inquiry the documents could have been got translated 36 as far as the questions framed by us in para 12 of this judgment are concerned we answer question no 1 by holding that in the facts of the present case the wbcpcr had not started an inquiry till 07 03 2017 as far as question no 2 is concerned we are of the view that there is no question of ouster of jurisdiction of any commission the only constraint placed by section 13 2 is that if the state commission has already started an inquiry the national commission should naturally refrain from inquiring into the matter this however does not mean that the national commission cannot go into the other larger questions which may have led to the specific incidents of violation of child rights which need to be inquired into with regard to question no 3 we hold that even state commission has the power to inquire into those matters which fall within its purview and even if the illegality is such that it has inter state or international ramifications g child is being illegally sent for adoption abroad here again we are of the view that if the state commission in such case asks for assistance from the national commission or some other state commission where the child may have been illegally trafficked the national commission or the other state commission should cooperate with the commission inquiring into the matter 37 as clearly held by us above both the commissions have to work for the best interest ofthe children in spirit of cooperation unfortunately in this case there has been no cooperation rather mudslinging at each other we would like to reiterate and re emphasise that there are no jurisdictional issues involved b d f h national commission for protection of child rights dr rajesh kumar deepak gupta 1001 38 in view of the above we are clearly of the view that dr rajesh kumar should have furnished the information which appears to now have been furnished by the state authorities if such information has not been furnished the present incumbent holding the post of adgp cid west bengal is directed to furnish the information to the national commission as well as to juvenile justice committee of the high court of calcutta within 15 days from the date of receipt of certified copy of this judgment the counsel for the state of west bengal shall inform the present additional director general of police criminal investigation department west bengal of these directions 39 as is evident from the facts narrated above both the state commission wbcpcr and the national commission have been woefully lax in the matter hence we direct that other than the issues which form part of the criminal case all other matters relating to the issue in hand and larger issues of appointment of cwcs and heads of cwcs not only as far as this case is concerned but also for the entire state of west bengal should be monitored by the high court of calcutta preferably by bench headed by the chairperson of the juvenile justice committee of the high court of calcutta in public interest litigation in furtherance of these directions we direct the registry of this court to send copy of this judgment to the registrar general of the calcutta high court who shall place the same before the hon ble chief justice of the high court for constitution of an appropriate bench we request the bench so constituted to deal with the matter as per the urgency involved and if required to establish fool proof mechanism so that such occurrences do not take place in future 40 this appeal is partly disposed of in the aforesaid terms in so far as the disputes inter se the ncpcr and wbcpcr are concerned we however make it clear that the issue of setting up of human rights courts and appointment of special public prosecutors for such human rights courts shall be dealt with in this appeal as well as in the writ petition no 819 of 2019 all pending application related to the dispute between the ncpcr and the dr rajesh kumar adgp cid west bengal respondent no 1 wbcpcr shall stand disposed of accordingly ankit gyan appeal partly disposed of b d f h '], ['120 supreme court reports 2019 14 c 120 2019 14 c

directed registration of fir for criminal offence s 9 of the act 2006 against the appellant it was alleged that appellant was only 17 years when he married respondent no 1 however it is not disputed that respondent no 1 wife of the appellant was major at the time of marriage held literal interpretation of ss 2 2 and 9 would mean that if male aged between the years of eighteen and twenty one contracts marriage with female above eighteen years of age female adult would not be punished but it is the male who would be punished for contracting child marriage though he himself is child however such interpretation goes against the object of the act the intention was to punish the male adults contracting child marriages to protect minor young girls this is also supported by the marginal note of the 9 which reads punishment for male adult marrying child thus the words male adult above eighteen years of age contracts child marriage in 9 should be read as male adult above eighteen years of age marries child in the instant case the high court committed error on the face of record as appellant was 17 years old e below eighteen years when he married respondent no 1 hence 9 was not applicable to the appellant accordingly the direction of the high court to register fir quashed and the impugned order set aside interpretation of statutes interpretation of statutes marginal note of section held it is well settled that where any ambiguity exists with regard to the interpretation of legislative provision the marginal note can be used in aid of construction having regard to the object of the legislation and the mischief it seeks to remedy 120 hardev singh harpreet kaur ors 121 allowing the appeal the court held 1 section 2 of the prohibition of child marriage act 2006 defines child as person who if male has not completed twenty one years of age and if female has not completed eighteen years of age under section 2 of the act child marriage means marriage to which either of the contracting parties is child thus even if the husband is between eighteen and twenty one years of age it can be treated as child marriage para 3 1 124 2 it is not in dispute that respondent no 1 wife of the appellant was major at the time of marriage the 2006 act does not make any provision for punishing female adult who marries male child hence literal interpretation of the above provisions of the 2006 act would mean that if male aged between the years of eighteen and twenty one contracts marriage with female above eighteen years of age the female adult would not be punished but it is the male who would be punished for contracting child marriage though he himself is child para 3 2 124 e 3 section 9 of the 2006 act must be viewed in the backdrop of the gender dimension to the practice of child marriage thus it can be inferred that the intention behind punishing only male adults contracting child marriages is to protect minor young girls from the negative consequences thereof by creating deterrent effect for prospective grooms who by virtue of being above eighteen years of age are deemed to have the capacity to opt out of such marriages however it cannot be gleaned that the legislators sought to punish male between the age of eighteen and twenty one years who contracts into marriage with female adult instead the 2006 act affords such male who is child for the purposes of the act the remedy of getting the marriage annulled by proceeding under section 3 of the 2006 act hence male adults between the age of eighteen and twenty one years of age who marry female adults cannot be brought under the ambit of section 9 as this is not the mischief that the provision seeks to remedy para 3 8 126 g b d f h 122 supreme court reports 2019 14 c 4 this view is supported by the marginal note of section 9 which reads punishment for male adult marrying child it is well settled that where any ambiguity exists with regard to the interpretation of legislative provision the marginal note can be used in aid of construction having regard to the object of the legislation and the mischief it seeks to remedy in view of the above the words male adult

reveal that the appellant and respondent no 1 married each other on 17 4 2010 without the consent of their parents it seems that the parents of respondent no 1 were creating problems for the couple

through the material on record and having heard learned counsel for the parties we are of the considered opinion that the high court could not have recalled its earlier order under section 482 cr c inasmuch as there is no provision for recalling or reviewing an order passed by it in criminal matters the order that was set aside was only protection order and there was no exceptional circumstance calling for an exercise of the high court inherent powers the high court was not justified in directing initiation of criminal proceedings against the appellant under section 9 of the 2006 act section 9 reads as under section 9 punishment for male adult marrying child whoever being male adult above eighteen years of age contracts child marriage shall be punishable with rigorous imprisonment which may extend to two years or with fine which may extend to one lakh rupees or with both emphasis supplied the high court has relied upon the school record of the appellant in directing prosecution against him under section 9 we find that the high court has committed grave error on the face of the record b d f h 124 supreme court reports 2019 14 c a c e g inasmuch as if the date of birth as given in the school certificate is accepted the appellant was 17 years old e below eighteen years of age when he married respondent no 1 hence section 9 cannot be applied to him 3 in any case even assuming that the appellant was aged eighteen years or above on the date of his marriage we are of the considered opinion that section 9 does not apply to the facts and circumstances of this case it is pertinent to refer to the overall scheme of the 2006 act in determining whether an offence under section 9 is made out 3 1 section 2 of the 2006 act defines child as person who if male has not completed twenty one years of age and if female has not completed eighteen years of age under section 2 of the act child marriage means marriage to which either of the contracting parties is child thus even if the husband is between eighteen and twenty one years of age it can be treated as child marriage 3 2 it is not in dispute that respondent no 1 wife of the appellant was major at the time of marriage the 2006 act does not make any provision for punishing female adult who marries male child hence literal interpretation of the above provisions of the 2006 act would mean that if male aged between the years of eighteen and twenty one contracts marriage with female above eighteen years of age the female adult would not be punished but it is the male who would be punished for contracting child marriage though he himself is child 3 3 we are of the view that such an interpretation goes against the object of the act as borne out in its legislative history undoubtedly the act is meant to eradicate the deplorable practice of child marriage which continues to be prevalent in many parts of our society the statement of objects and reasons declares that prohibition of child marriage is major step towards enhancing the health of both male and female children as well as enhancing the status of women in particular notably therefore significant motivation behind the introduction of this legislation was to curb the disproportionate adverse impact of this practice on child brides in particular 3 4 after being passed by the rajya sabha when the prohibition of child marriage bill 2006 was introduced for discussion in the 14th lok sabha by smt renuka chowdhury the then minister of state for hardev singh harpreet kaur ors mohan shantanagoudar 125 women and child development she emphatically highlighted how child marriage reinforces gender discrimination in the country unfortunately here in india today gender is matter of life and death boys live and girls die and that is the tragedy of our times these girls are then denied access to schools they are made to look after their younger siblings they have no access to food security much less to immunization they are anemic they are subjected to untold exposures of infections and horrors and as soon as they enter their reproductive years irrespective of the fact that they live in tropical country like ours where onset of reproductive years is much earlier than in some other countries these children are then sent off to be married and they become mothers at that age at that stage of malnutrition at that stage of denial of food security and at that stage of incubating disease whereby they in turn give birth to malnutrition children after that these children are then vulnerable to domestic violence alcoholic husbands who come home and beat them abuse of different kinds trafficking taken away and exposed to horrors of such type that we cannot even begin to imagine although the child marriage restraint act 1929 was brought into force nearly 77 years ago it only brought restraint it did not talk of prevention or removal 3 5 further the law commission of india has also noted that child marriage is far more prevalent amongst girls whose husbands are often much older than them therefore compromising their development see the 205th report of the law commission of india on the proposal to amend the prohibition of child marriage act 2006 and other allied laws at pages 15 23 3 6 it is also pertinent in this regard to refer to the prevention of child marriage bill 2004 2004 bill which preceded the 2006 act clauses 2 2 and 9 of the 2004 bill are in pari materia with the corresponding sections of the 2006 act except insofar as clause 9 of the 2004 bill prescribed simple imprisonment whereas section 9 of the 2006 act prescribes rigorous imprisonment for the offence the parliamentary standing committee on personnel public grievances law and justice in its thirteenth report on the 2004 bill notes that although c e g 126 supreme court reports 2019 14 c a c e g both men and women are deemed to have attained majority at eighteen years of age under other laws differential metric has been adopted for the purposes of defining child marriage higher age is prescribed for men based on the prevailing societal notions that the age of eighteen years is insufficient for boy to attain the desired level of education and economic independence and that an age gap ought to be maintained between the groom and the bride 3 7 however the 2004 bill as also the 2006 act treats men who are above the age of 18 as having sufficient maturity to be held responsible for marrying female child the report also notes that the purpose of clause 9 of the 2004 bill is to provide adequate penal consequences for male adult who marries child however an adult woman is exempt from punishment for marrying male child as in society like ours decisions regarding marriage are usually taken by the family members of the bride and groom and women generally have little say in the matter we hasten to emphasise that we do not wish to comment on the desirability of maintaining the aforesaid distinction in culpability however the context in which this distinction was considered appropriate by the legislature must be taken into account 3 8 section 9 of the 2006 act must be viewed in the backdrop of this gender dimension to the practice of child marriage thus it can be inferred that the intention behind punishing only male adults contracting child marriages is to protect minor young girls from the negative consequences thereof by creating deterrent effect for prospective grooms who by virtue of being above eighteen years of age are deemed to have the capacity to opt out of such marriages nowhere from the discussion above can it be gleaned that the legislators sought to punish male between the age of eighteen and twenty one years who contracts into marriage with female adult instead the 2006 act affords such male who is child for the purposes of the act the remedy of getting the marriage annulled by proceeding under section 3 of the 2006 act hence male adults between the age of eighteen and twenty one years of age who marry female adults cannot be brought under the ambit of section 9 as this is not the mischief that the provision seeks to remedy 3 9 our views are supported by the marginal note of section 9 which reads punishment for male adult marrying child it is well settled that where any ambiguity exists with regard to the interpretation of legislative provision the marginal note can be used in aid of hardev singh harpreet kaur ors mohan shantanagoudar 127 construction having regard to the object of the legislation and the mischief it seeks to remedy in view of the above the words male adult above eighteen years of age contracts child marriage in section 9 of the 2006 act should be read as male adult above eighteen years of age marries child 4 having regard to the above discussion section 9 of the 2006 act does not apply to the present case at all by way of abundant caution we wish to clarify that we are not commenting on the validity of marriages entered into by man aged between eighteen and twenty one years and an adult woman in such cases the man may have the option to get his marriage annulled under section 3 of the 2006 act subject to the conditions prescribed therein 5 be that as it may it is brought to our notice by the advocates for the parties herein that the couple has been living happily and are not facing any threat from their family members hence we are of the opinion that police protection is no more required in the present case 6 in view of the above the directions issued by the high court to get

were seized this constitutes sufficient evidence to hold that there is prima facie case against the petitioner 4 to understand the severity of the offence it is imperative to note the legislative history of the pc pndt act reference may be had to the preamble which states as follows an act to provide for the prohibition of sex selection before or after conception and for regulation of prenatal diagnostic techniques for the purposes of detecting genetic abnormalities or metabolic disorders or chromosomal abnormalities or certain congenital malformations or sex linked disorders and for the prevention of their misuse for sex determination leading to female foeticide and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto emphasis supplied the passage of this act was compelled by cultural history of preference for the male child in india rooted in patriarchal web of religious economic and social factors this has birthed numerous social evils such as female infanticide trafficking of young girls and bride buying and now with the advent of technology sex selection and female feticide the pervasiveness of this preference is reflected through the census data on the skewed sex ratio in india starting from the 1901 census which recorded 972 females per 1000 males there was an overall decline to 941 females in 1961 and 930 females in 1971 going further down to 927 females in 1991 records of lok sabha discussions on the pre natal diagnostic techniques regulation and prevention of misuse bill 1991 reflect various members concern with this alarming state of affairs which acted as clarion call to the passage of the pc pndt b d f h 318 supreme court reports 2021 2 c a act see lok sabha debates tenth series vol xxxiii no 2 july 26 1994 eleventh session at pages 506 544 the prevalence of pre natal sex selection and feticide has also attracted international censure and provoked calls for strict regulation in september 1995 the un 4th world conference on women adopted the beijing declaration and platform for action which inter alia declared female feticide and pre natal sex selection as forms of violence against women see beijing declaration and platform for action adopted in 16th plenary meeting of un 4th world conference on women 15th september 1995 article 115 while the sex ratio has improved since after the passage of the pc pndt act rising to 933 as per the 2001 census and then to 943 in the 2011 census these pernicious practices still remain rampant as per the reply filed by the then minister of state health and family welfare in the rajya sabha on 27 3 2018 as of december 2017 around 3 986 court cases had been filed under the act resulting in only 449 convictions and 136 cases of suspension of medical licenses the unrelenting continuation of this immoral practice the globally shared understanding that it constitutes form of violence against women and its potential to damage the very fabric of gender equality and dignity that forms the bedrock of our constitution are all factors that categorically establish pre natal sex determination as grave offence with serious consequences for the society as whole 5 we may also refer with benefit to the observations of this court in voluntary health association of india state of punjab 2013 4 scc 1 as follows 6 above statistics is an indication that the provisions of the act are not properly and effectively being implemented there has been no effective supervision or follow up action so as to achieve the object and purpose of the act mushrooming of various sonography centres genetic clinics genetic counselling centres genetic laboratories ultrasonic clinics imaging centres in almost all parts of the country calls for more vigil and attention by the authorities under the act but unfortunately their functioning is not being properly monitored or supervised by the authorities under the act or to find out whether c e g rekha sengar state of madhya pradesh mohan shantanagoudar 319 they are misusing the pre natal diagnostic techniques for determination of sex of foetus leading to foeticide 7 seldom the ultrasound machines used for such sex determination in violation of the provisions of the act are seized and even if seized they are being released to the violators of the law only to repeat the crime hardly few cases end in conviction the cases booked under the act are pending disposal for several years in many courts in the country and nobody takes any interest in their disposal and hence seldom those cases end in conviction and sentences fact well known to the violators of law in the present case contrary to the prevailing practice the investigative team has seized the sonography machine and made out strong prima facie case against the petitioner therefore we find it imperative that no leniency should be granted at this stage as the same may reinforce the notion that the pc pndt act is only paper tiger and that clinics and laboratories can carry out sex determination and feticide with impunity strict approach has to be adopted if we are to eliminate the scourge of female feticide and iniquity towards girl children from our society though it certainly remains open to the petitioner to disprove the merits of these allegations at the stage of trial 6 the fact that on 13 10 2020 the co accused in the present case was released on bail by the high court in mcrc no 39380 2020 does not alter our conclusions the allegations in the fir and the charge sheet as well the disclosure statements made by the petitioner and the co accused under section 27 of the indian evidence act 1872 reveal that prima facie the petitioner had more active role in conducting the alleged illegal medical practices of sex determination and sex selective abortion whereas the alleged role of the co accused was limited to merely picking up and dropping off the petitioner clients hence we find no grounds for granting parity with the co accused to the petitioner 7 thus in view of the presence of prima facie evidence against the petitioner and other factors as referred to supra we find ourselves compelled to uphold the impugned order of the high court denying bail to the petitioner however in light of this court directions in voluntary health association of india supra mandating speedy disposal of such cases it is open for the petitioner to request the trial court to expedite her trial and decide it within period of 1 year c e g 320 supreme court reports 2021 2 c 8 we make it clear that the above observations on facts are

was assaulted and abused by and as result she left the home and started working in the house of accused as maid servant in the house of some girls used to come after few days when one girl did not

police station she was medically examined on 22 04 2007 her radiological bone assessment suggested her age to be between 14 16 years respondents were not named in the first information report however prosecutrix made several statements thereafter implicating the respondents when respondents came to know that they have been named by the said girl they absconded they med an application for anticipatory bail before the sessions judge which was dismissed thereafter they filed application for anticipatory bail before the high court which was allowed on the ground that the prosecutrix being major and having willingly consented for sex for consideration primafacie case under 376 ipc is not made out and thahince prosecutrix was stationed in the remand home she waltully protected in appeal to this court state contended that the high court committed serious error in passing the impugned judgment inasmuch as from various public documents it is evident that the date of birth of the prosecutrix is 28 06 1991 and thus at all material times namely from january 2007 to 22 04 2007 she was minor and in that view of the matter the purported consent given by her would not be of much significance that in the first information report the names of the respondents had not been taken but in case of this nature the court should have considered the fact that she had been arrested by the police and as such it is just possible that she was not in position to recollect all the details y allowing the appeal the court state mohd sajid husain mohd husain etc 997 held 1 the four factors which are relevant for considering the application for grant of anticipatory bail are the nature and gravity or seriousness of accusation as apprehended by the applicant ii the antecedents of the applicant including the fact as to whether he has on conviction by court previously undergone imprisonment for term in respect of any cognizable offence iii the likely object of the accusation to humiliate or malign the reputation of the applicant by having him so arrested and iv the possibility of the appellant if granted anticipatory bail fleeing from justice para 13 1005 c 2 1 if the prosecutrixwas minor consent on her part will pale into insignificance she had been medically examined and her approximate age on the basis of radiological test as determined to be between 14 to 16 years her date of birth was recorded on 04 07 1996 by the parbhani municipal council as 28 06 1991 the said certificate was issued on 29 05 2007 but evidently the date of registration of the said certificate was 04 07 1996 e much before any controversy arose three school leaving certificates had been placed wherein her date of birth was shown as 28 06 1991 she had been as per the said certificates studying in 9th standard she dropped out from the school para 14 1005 f e 2 2 the date of issuance of the certificates had not been stated but evidently such certificates had been obtained by the prosecution it may be true that in the first information report as also in her first supplementary examination her age was recorded as 18 years but she had been examined medically the possibility of her trying to shield her from prosecution at the time of her arrest and for that purpose disclosing her age to be 18 years cannot be ruled out para 15 1005 1006 b 2 3 mistake in regard to her age as recorded in the first information report or the first medical document or even in her supplementary affidavit should yield to the public documents which have been produced by the prosecution at this stage even before the chief judicial magistrate she disclosed her date of birth to be 22 06 1991 therefore even according to that she was below 16 998 supreme court reports 2007 10

names had been taken by the prosecutrix in her supplementary statement they had been absconding for long time the respondents had not scrupulously complied with the conditions imposed upon them admittedly at least on four occasions some of them were not present para 18 1006 g hj 4 the high court has in regard to the first factor envisaged under the maharashtra amendment of 438 of the code of criminal procedure proceeded on the basis that the prosecutrix was girl of easy virtue this may be so but the same by itself may not be relevant consideration case of this nature should be allowed to

the accused persons must be named in the first information report it has not been denied nor disputed that the pro secutrix does not bear any animosity against the respondents there is no reason for her to falsely implicate them it is also not case that she did so the behest of some other person who may be inimically disposed of towards the respondents the prosecution has disclosed the manner in which she was being taken from place to place which finds some corroboration from the testimonies of the other witnesses and thus at least at this stage her evidence should not be rejected outrightly

submitted the session judge also did not grant bail to some of the accused persons if on the same materials prayer for regular bail has been rejected there is no reason to enlarge respondents on

assessment suggested her age to be between 14 16 years respondents herein were not named in the first information report however puja made several statements thereafter implicating the respondents herein she also gave her statement under section 164 of the code of criminal procedure cr pc respondents having come to know that they have been named by the said girl absconded they filed an application for anticipatory bail before the learned sessions judge aurangabad the same was dismissed by an order dated 24 05 2007 6 respondents moved the high court thereagainst and by reason ofthe impugned judgment dated 27 06 2007 the said application for anticipatory bail was allowed inter alia holding that the prosecutrix being major and having willingly consented for sex for consideration prima facie case under section 376 ipc has not been made out it was furthermore held that she being stationed in the remand home at aurangabad was fully protected and thus the question of the j 1002 supreme court reports 2007 10 c a respondents being in position to influence her does not arise 7 the state is thus before us 8 mr ravindra keshavrao adsure learn counsel appe ng on behalf of the state would inter alia submit that the high court committed a serious error in passmg the impugned judgment inasmuch as from various public documents it is evident that the date of birth of the prosecutrix is 28 06 1991 and thus at all material times namely from january 2007 to 22 04 2007 she was minor and in that view of the matter the purported consent given by her would not be of much significance d the learned counsel would contend that it is true that in the first information report the names of the respondents had not been taken but in case of this nature the court should have considered the fact that she had been arrested by the police and as such it is just possible that she was not in position to recollect all the details in any event the first information report being not encyclopedic any evidence which has been collected by the prosecution during the course of investigation should have been taken into consideration having regard to the nature and gravity of the offence the learned counsel would submit that the prosecutrix in her statement recorded by the police had made categorical allegations against accused nos 7 9 10 11 12 13 14 and 15 she made similar statement before the learned magistrate which was recorded under section 164 cr pc on 28 04 2007 it was pointed out that all the accused persons had been absconding from 24 05 2007 to 11 06 2007 the learned counsel would submit that as an investigation had been conducted by the cid under the supervision of superintendent of police it cannot be said that any attempt had been made to falsely implicate the respondents it was pointed out that chargesheet had been submitted against the six accused persons on 18 07 2007 and they have been refused bail by the same learned judge keeping in view the fact that she was taken to hqtel guest houses and apartment custodial interrogation of the accused is imperative a y statev mohd sajidhusainmohd husainetc 1003 sinha 9 mr paramjit singh patwalia learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents on the other hand pointed out that in the first information report in her medical examination as also in her supplementary statement the prosecutrix stated her age to be 18 years even her aunt stated her age to be 18 years it was in the aforementioned situation it was urged no reliance can be placed on the purported birth certificate which was issued on 29 05 2007 by the parbhani municipal council and the school leave certificates by different schools as also the medical certificate stating her age to be between 14 to 16 years the learned counsel would submit that prima facie the girl was above 16 years and she being consenting party and having been getting consideration no case under section 376 ipc having been made out and thus this court should not interfere with the impugned judgment it was contended that pursuant to the interim order passed by the high court the respondent have fully been cooperating with the investigating officer and except for four days they have scrupulously complied with the conditions imposed by interim order passed by the high court as also the conditions imposed upon them by the high court in the impugned judgment it was furthermore pointed out that during the aforementioned period they subjected themselves to medical examination and took part in the test identification parade but no recovery was made from them it was pointed out that chargesheet had been submitted against six persons who are in custody and in that view of the matter it is not case where custodial interrogation would be necessary the learned counsel would contend that although there exists distinction in regard to the exercise of jurisdiction of this court on an appeal from an order granting or refusing the prayer for grant of anticipatory bail and one of cancellation of bail it is trite that this court ordinarily would not interfere strong reliance in this behalf has been placed on state of

a was called for from the superintendent of police crime investigation department aurangabad the said authority has sent report to this court wherein it has inter alia been pointed out that the respondents accused persons had been absconding for long time and they during the course of interrogation have been giving evasive answers 11 it was furthermore stated that from the residence of accused no 3 thirteen cds of blue films and books instigating sex had been seized it was also submitted that recovery of vehicles used by the respondents from time to time for commission of the offence are yet to be seized and if they are released on bail they would tamper with evidence 12 section 438 of cr pc has been amended by the state of maharashtra by act no 24 of 1993 which reads as under 438 direction far grant of bail to person apprehending arrest 1 when any person has reason to believe that he may be arrested on an cusat on of having committed non bailable offence he may apply to the high court or the court of session for direction under this section that in the event of such arrest he shall be released on bail and that court may after taking into consideration inter alia the following factors the nature and gravity or seriousness of the accusation as apprehended by the applicant ii the antecedents of the applicant including the fact as to whether he has on conviction by court previously undergone imprisonment for term in respect of any cognizable offence iii the likely object of the accusation to humiliate or malign the reputation of the applicant by having him so

rejected the application for grant of anticipatory bail it shall be open to an officer in charge of police station to arrest without warrant the applicant on the basis of the accusation apprehended in such application 13 the four factors which are relevant for considering the application for grant of anticipatory bail are the nature and gravity or seriousness of accusation as apprehended by the applicant ii the antecedents of the applicant including the fact as to whether he has on conviction by court previously undergone imprisonment for term in respect of any cognizable offence rii the likely object of the accusation to humiliate or malign the reputation of the applicant by having him so arrested and iv the possibility of the appellant if granted anticipatory bail fleeing from justice 14 it is not in dispute that ifthe prosecutrix was minor consent on her part will pale into insignificance she had been medically examined and her approximate age on the basis of radiological test was determined to be between 14 to 16 years her date of birth was recorded on 04 07 1996 by the parbhani municipal council parbhani as 28 06 1991 the name of her father was also mentioned therein as sahebrao mhaske the said certificate was issued on 29 05 2007 but evidently the date ofregistration of the said certificate was 04 07 1996 e much before any controversy arose three school leaving certificates had been placed before us which have been issued by sarjudevi bhikulal bharuka arya kanya vidyalaya hingoli ii bal vidya mandir high school parbhani and iii model english educational societies sharda vidya mandir parbhani wherein her date of birth was shown as 28 06 1991 she had been as per the said certificates studying in 9th standard she dropped out from the school 15 it may be true that the date of issuance of the certificates had 1006 supreme court reports 2007 10 c a not been stated but evidently such certificates had been obtained by the prosecution it may be true that in the first information report as also in ht first supplementary examination her age was recorded as 18 years but she had been examined medically the possibility of her trying to shield her from prosecution at the time of her arrest and for that purpose disclosing her age to be 18 years cannot be ruled out 16 so far as the fact that the respondents have not been named in the first information report is concerned suffice it to say that the first information report may be encyclopedic 17 in vinod asrani state of maharashtra 2007 3 scale 241 this court stated as pointed out by mr ahmed this court in the case of kari choudhary sita devi and ors had while considering similar question observed that the ultimate object of every investigation is to find out whether the offences allege cl to have been committed and if so who had committed it the scheme of the code of criminal procedure makes it clear that once the information of the commission of an offence is received under section 154 of the gode of criminal procedure the investigating authorities take up the investigation and file charge sheet against whoever is found during tl1e investigation to have been involved in the commission of such offence there is no hard and fast rule that the first information report must always contain the names of all persons who were involved in the commission of an offence very often the names of the culprits are not even mentioned in the lr and they surface only at the stage of the investigation d f 18 out of the eight respondents five are police officers two are politicians and one is owner of hotel it is not in dispute that after having come to learn that their names had been taken by the prosecutrix in her supplementary statement they had been absconding for long time it is not necessary for us to record their respective period of abscondance we may furthermore notice that the respondents had not scrupulously complied with the conditions imposed upon them admittedly at least on four occasions some of them were not present state mohd sajid husain mohd husainetc 1007 sinha 19 we need not go into the question as to whether they had been cooperating with the investigating officer or not we may however poll1t out that before us copy of the affidavit dated 10 05 2007 affirmed by sunita sahebrao mhaske was placed wherein she alleged that puja wa5 born on 30 12 1988 on that basis the gram panchayat dhanki had also issued certificate showing the same to be her date of birth we have an uncanny feeling that evidently the evidences are being collected by somebody who intends to save the accused 20 there cannot be any direct proof that the respondents have been tempering with evidence but that question will have to be considered by the appropriate authority at the appropriate stage 21 immoral trafficking is now widespread victims who are lured coerced or threatened for the purpose of bringing them to the trade should be given all protection we at this stage although cannot enter into the details in regard to the merit of the matter so as to prejudice the case of one party or the other at the trial but it is now well settled principle of law that while granting anticipatory bail the court must record the reasons therefor 22 the high court has in regard to the first factor envisaged under the maharashtra amendment of section 438 of the code of criminal procedure proceeded on the basis that the prosecutrix was girl of easy virtue this may be so but the same by itself may not be relevant consideration see state of up pappu alias yunus and anr 2005 3 sec 594 23 case of this nature should be allowed to be fully investigated once criminal case is set in motion by lodging an information in regard to the commission of the offence in terms of section 154 cr pc it may not always be held to be imperative that all the accused persons must be named in the first information report it has not been denied nor disputed that the prosecutrix does not bear any animosity against the respondents there is no reason for her to falsely implicate them it is also not case that she did so at the behest of some other person who may be inimically disposed of towards the respondents the prosecution has disclosed the manner in which she was being taken from place to place which finds 1008 supreme court reports 2007 10 c a some corroboration from the testimonies of the other witnesses and thus we can safely arrive at conclusion that at least at this stage her evidence should not be rejected outrightly 24 parameters for grant of anticipatory bail in such serious offence being under section 376 376 2 ipc in our opinion are required to be satisfied see g k ganesh babu p manokaran and ors 20011 4 sec 434 25 mistake in regard to her age as recorded in the first information report or the first medical document or even in her supplementary affidavit should yield to the public documents which have been produced by the prosecution at this stage even before the learned chief judicial magistrate she disclosed her date of birth to be 22 06 1991 therefore even according to that she was below 16 years of age 26 immoral conduct on the part of police officers should not be encouraged we fail to understand as to how the police officers could go underground they had been changing their residence very frequently although most of them were police officers their whereabouts were not known during the aforementioned period attempts had been made even by mahananda to obtain the custody of the girl at whose instance we do not know on the one hand mahananda had been praying for the custody of the girl and sunita the mother of the girl as noticed hereinbefore had affirmed an affidavit in relation to her date of birth these may not be acts of voluntariness on their part it therefore in our opinion is case where no anticipatory bail should have been granted g 27 reliance has been placed by mr patwalia on amarmani tripathi supra this court therein opined that in an application for cancellation of bail conduct subsequent to release on bail and the supervening circumstances alone are relevant but the court while considering an appeal against grant of anticipatory bail would keep in mind the parameters laid down therefor the matter however may be different for deciding an appeal from an order granting bail where the accused has been at large for considerable time in which event the post bail conduct and other supervening circumstances will also have to be taken note of st te mohd sajid husain mohd husain etc 1009 sinha this court inamarmani tripathi supra aforementioned case upon considering even the subsequent events came to the conclusion that the accused therein had tried to interfere with the course of the investigation tamper with the witnesses fabricate evidence intimidate or create obstacles in the path of investigation officers and derail the case in that case the appeal granting bail was set aside 28 we may also notice that the high court itself has refused to grant regular bail to the accused against whom charge sheet has been submitted the learned session judge also did not grant bail to some of the accused persons if on the same materials prayer for regular baii has been rejected we fail to see any reason as to why and on what basis the respondents could be enlarged on anticipatory bail 29 in the peculiar fact and circumstances of the case we are of the opinion that the high court ought not to have granted anticipatory bail to the respondents the impugned judgment therefore cannot be sustained which is set aside accordingly the appeal is allowed 30 the respondents may surrender before the chief judicial magistrate and move an application for regular bail which may be considered on its own merit withoutbeing influenced in any way by the judgment of this court d appeal allowed '], ['a jayawanf datiatr ay suryarao state of maharashtra november 5 200 b b shah

imagine that as the witness has seen the accused for few minutes it would be difficult for him to identify it always depends upon one capacity to recapitulate what he has seen earlier power of perception and memorising differs from man to man and also depends upon situation finally appreciation of such evidence would depend upon the strength and trustworthiness of witnesses 96 b h jayawant

rightly tried and convicted the accused for the offences punishable under the tada that act cannot be termed as simple act of gang rivalry it is true that it is difficult to define terrorism in precise terms whether the criminal violent act was committed with intent to strike terror in people or section of people would always depend upon facts of each case for finding out the intention of the accused there would hardly be any case where there could be direct evidence it is to be inferred from the manner and mode adopted while committing the act and its after effect including fear psychosis 97 h 98 2 2 from the circumstances in the present case irresistible inference can be drawn that crime was committed to create terror and also to take revenge such act creates terror in the minds of the people or section of the people so that the targeted persons would succumb to the dictates or extortion because offear for survival in the present case the psi who was on duty resigned from his job suffered mental depression spent sleepless nights and worried about the safety of his family after lapse of seven years of incident retired army officer deposing before the court appeared to be scared and started weeping in the witness box effect of fear psychosis also can be seen from the statement of a2 that he was compelled to use his official vehicle along with police constable for the movement of the ac cused in such cases it would hardly be possible to get idence of eye witnesses 98 d b d f 3 1 confessional statement before the police officer under section 15 of tada act is substantive evidence and it can be relied upon in the trial of such person or co accused abettor or conspirator for an offence punishable under the act or the rules the police officer before recording the confession has to observe the requirement of sub section 2 of section 15 irregularities here and there would not make such confessional state ment inadmissible in evidence if the legislature in its wisdom has pro vided after considering the situation prevailing in the society that such confessional statement can be used as evidence it would not be just reasonable and prudent to water down the scheme of the act on the assumption that the said statement was recorded under duress or was not 58 supreme court reports 2001 supp 5 c recorded trujy by the concerned officer in whom faith is reposed it is true that there may be some cases whert the power is misused by the concerned authority but contention can be raised in almost all cases and it would be for the court to decide to what extent the said statement is to be used ideal goal may be confessional statement is made by the accused as repentance for his crime but for achieving such ideal goal there must be altogether different atmosphere in the society hence unless foolproof method is evolved by the society or such atmosphere is created there is no alternative but to implement the law as it is 98 h 99 3 2 confessional statement in the present case is admissible in evi dence and is substantive evidence it also could be relied upon for connect ing the co accused with the crime minor irregularity would not vitiate it evidentiary value it cannot be said that the confessional statement be comes doubtful and inadmissible in evidence because there was delay in sending it to the chief judicial magistrate and it was not sent forthwith as required under rule 15 of the tada rules as per rule 15 what is mandatory is that the confessional statement should be forwarded to the designated court which may take cognizance of the offence such viola tion of the rule cannot be held to be incurable illegality it also cannot be said that confessional statements of other acquitted accused cannot be relied upon for connecting

other police con stable wh9 were ori duty imd o are dead were unintentional it is also submitted that incident took place at 3 45 m e early in the morning and therefore also berewas no question of creating any terror in the mind of public at large for this purpose iearn counsel referred to niranjan singh karam singh punjabi advocare iitewlh1 bhimraj bijjaya and ors 1990 4 scc 76 in the aforesaid case this court held that the designated court was right in coming to rhe conclusion that the intention of the accused was to eliminate raju and keshav for gaining supremacy in the underworld and observed thus mere statement to the effect that the show of such violence would cr ate terror or feadn the minds of the people and none would dare to oppose them cannot constitute an offence under section 3 1 of the act that may indeed be the fall out of the violent act but that cannot be said to be the intention of the perpetrators of the crime in the aforesaid case the court has clarified that intention of the accused was only to eliminate raju and ke hav and therefore they killed the former and caused injury to later and it s not possible to hold that their intention was to strike terror in the people or section of the people the court thereafter pertinently observed that it would have been different matter if to strike terror some innocent persons were killed nd in such case the intention could be to strike terror and the kill ings woum be to achieve that objective learned counsel further referred to the decision in state nalini and others 1999 5 scc 253 this judgment also does not in any way support their contentions three judge bench of this court quoted the dictum laid down in hitendra vishnu thakur state of maharashtra and ors 1994 4 scc 11 c e g jayawant dattatray suryarao state shah 89 602 with approval and concluded thus para 51 298 the legal position remains unaltered that the crucial postulate for judging whether the offence is terrorist act falling under ada or not is whether it was done with the intent to overawe the government as by law established or to strike terror in the people etc in hitendra vishnu thakur supra dealing with similar contention this court held para 7 618 thus b terrorist activity does not merely arise by causing distur bance of law and order or of public order the fall out of the intended activity must be such that it travels beyond the capacity of the ordinary law enforcement agencies to tackle it under the ordinary penal law experience has shown us that terrorism is generally an attempt to acquire or maintain power or control by intimidation and causing fear and helplessness in the minds of the people at large or any section thereof and is totally abnormal phenomenon what distinguishes terrorism from other forms of violence therefore appears to be the deliberate and systematic use of coercive intimidation more often than not hardened criminal today takes advantage of the situation and by wearing the cloak of terrorism aims to achieve for himself acceptability and respectability in the society because unfortunately in the states affected by militancy terrorist is projected as hero by his group and often even by the misguided youth e similarly in girdhari parmanand vadhava state of maharashtra 1996 11 sec 179 this court observed that if an innocent boy is killed only because the demand fo ransom amount was not met by the family members such killing cannot but send shockwave and bring about terror in the minds of the people of the locality the court further held thus it is the impact of the crime and its fallout on the society and the potentiality of such crime in pmducing fear in the minds of the people or section of the people which makes crime terrorist activity under section 3 1 of ada in our view it is not possible to define terrorism by precise words whether the act was committed with intent to strike terror in the people or g 90 supreme court reports 2001 supp 5 c section of the people would depend upon facts of each case further for finding out intention of the accused there would hardly be few cases where there could be direct evidence mainly it is to be inferred from the circumstances of each case in appropriate cases from the nature of violent act inference can be culled out there can also be no doubt that fall out of violent act vary from person ro person and society to society but s well understood by prudent person and by those who are affected the prosecution version as revealed from the confessional statements and other evidence is that there are two gangs operating in mumbai e one of dawood ibrahim and other of arun gavli their activities are of eliminating or causing harm or injury to those who do not obey their dictates and of extortion from builders hoteliers industrialists professionals and others per sons they also indulge in smuggling and drug trafficking and for undertaking all these activities in organised manner they employ number of persons their code word for such activities is game may be that they are getting some support from the authorities or politicians and vice versa not only this it would be totally unjust to ignore the ground reality that these terrorist gangs operate and extort large amount of money through terrorism they acquire or maintain power or control by intimidation and causing fear and helplessness in the minds of the people at large they are hardened criminals and take advantage of the situation and in many cases police authorities fail to protect victims as confessed by 2 suryarao president of bhiwandi municipal corporation he sought assistance from 7 and others and thereafter it is his say that he was required to comply with the illegal demand of 7 of rendering assistance to 6 and 7 after commission of the offence further the intention of the accused could be gathered from their act of shooting the police guards who were on duty and causing injury to others whosoever came in their way in such situation it could he inferred that the dastardly act was to administer terror or shock wave in the people at large and convey that the fate of all those who did not obey their dictates or oppose them would be the same as that of shailesh haldankar it further conveys that police guard on duty can not save the victim but they also may meet the same fate not only this the crime was perpetuated in protected place e j hospital by master minding the operation of achieving the target necessary information was collected and after equipping themselves with sophisticated weapons they went to the hospital where patients and staff on duty went helter skelter witnesses turned hostile pw42 psi thakur who was police officer on duty could not b d f h jayawant dattatray suryarao state shah 91 do anything to protect anyone and after giving detailed fir failed to support the same before the court how the witnesses are terrorised can be seen from the evidence of pw42 who had lodged the fir he resigned from the post and was suffering mental depression and spending sleepless nights and was much more worried because of the incident about the safety of his family at the time of giving evidence he was feeling tense even after lapse of seven years of the incident similar was the position of pw54 shankar ramchandra jadhav further pw28 shrirang gangaram uttekar hostile witness watch man at the gate of j hospital was so scared that in the cross examination when he was asked about accused no lo court noted the witness appears to be scared and started looking to the court and turning his eyes in various directions the special judge also observed that from the appearance the witness appears to be scared and attempt was made to make him easy but attempt failed and finally witness started weeping in the witness box further confession by 2 reveals how the persons in clutches of these gangs are terrorised hence there is no substance in the contention of the learned counsel for the accused that there was no intention on the part of the accused to strike terror and that the crime would not be covered by the terrorist activity as provided under section 3 1 of tad we would again reiterate that whether the crime committed creates terror or not depends upon the facts and circum stances of each case and cannot be defined by precise words admissibility of confessional statements the next submission raised by the learned counsel for the accused is with regard to the admissibility and evidentiary value of the confessional statements it has been contended that confessional statements of the accused were re corded by the police officers when accused were in police custody after recording of confessional statements they were not produced before the judi cial magistrate and the confessional statements were sent to the concerned chief judicial magistrate after lapse of time thereby committing breach of rule 15 of tada rules and therefore the confessional statements are not admis sible in evidence and in any case they are not voluntary reliable and truthful f in our view for appreciating this contention we have to bear in mind the provisions of section 15 which begin with non obstante clause that notwith standing anything contained in the code or in the indian evidence act such statements shall be admissible in trial of such persons or co accused abettor 92 supreme court reports 2001 supp 5 c a or conspirator for an offence under the act or rules made thereunder if we keep in mind that the provisions of the evidence act to the aforesaid extent are to be ignored then there would not be much force in the contention raised by the learned counsel for the appellants under the act and the rules conditions for recording the confessional statements arc required to be satis fied if those conditions are complied with then the statements are admissible in evidence for connecting the accused or co accused with the crime how ever this aspect does not require much discussion as it has been dealt with and considered in various decisions of this court in lal singh state of gujarat and am 2001 3 scc 221 this court has held that in view of section 15 of the tada which lifted the bar provided under the evidence act confessional statement recorded by the police officers is admissible in evidence is substan tive evidence and during the trial it could be relied upon against the co accused also the court held in para 23 thus custodial interrogation in such cases is permissible under the law to meet grave situation arising out of ferrorism unleashed by terrorist activities by persons residing within or outside the country the learned counsel further submitted that in the present case the guide lines suggested by this court in kartar singh state of punjab 1994 3 scc 569 were not followed in our view this submission is without any basis because in the present case confessional statements were recorded prior to the date of decision in the said case e before 11 3 1994 further despite the suggestion made by this court in kartar singh case the said guidelines are neither incorporated in the act nor in the rules by the parliament therefore it would be difficult to accept the contention raised by learned counsel for the accused that as the said guidelines are not followed confessional statements even if admissibl in evidence should not be relied upon for convicting the accused further this court has not held in kartar singh case that if suggested guidelines are not followed then confessional statement would be inadmissible in evidence similar contention was negatived by this court in n dube n bhoir 2000 2 scc 254 by holding that police officer recording the confession under section 15 is really not bound to follow any other procedure and the rules or the guidelines framed by the bombay high court for recording the confession by magistrate under section 164 cr c the said guidelines do not by themselves apply to recording of confession under section 15 of the c e g jayawantdaitatraysuryaraov state shah 93 tada act and it is for the court to appreciate the confessional statement as the substantive piece of evidence and find out whether it is voluntary and truthful further by majority decision in state nalini and ors 1999 5 scc 253 the court negatived the contentions that confessional statement is not substantive piece of evidence and cannot be used against the co accused unless it is corroborated in material particulars by other evidence and the confession of one accused cannot corroborate the confession of another by holding that to that extent the provisions of evidence act including section 30 would not be applicable the decision in nalini case was considered in n dube case the court observed that section 15 is an important departure from the ordinary law and must receive that interpretation which would achieve the object of that provision and not frustrate or truncate it and that the correct legal position is that confession recorded under section 15 of the tada act is substantive piece of evidence and can be used against co accused also in this view of settled legal position confessional statement is admissible in evidence and is substantive evidence it also could be relied upon for connecting the co accused with the crime minor irregularity would not vitiate its evidentiary value further the contention of the learned counsel for the accused that because there was delay in sending the confessional statement to the chief judicial magistrate and it was not sent forthwith as required under rule 15 of the tada rules it becomes doubtful and inadmissible in evidence also requires to be rejected as per rule 15 what is mandatory is that the confessional statement should be forwarded to the designated court which may take cognizance of the offence such violation of the rule cannot be held to be incurable illegality re wariyam singh and others state of p 1995 6 sec 458 learneu senior counsel further submitted that confessional statements of other acquitted accused cannot be relied upon for connecting the accused with the crime in case of nalini supra this court while dealing with the con tention that if the accused are acquitted for the offence punishable under tada then their confessional statements cannot be relied upon for convicting the accused for other offences negatived the same and observed in para 82 the correct position is that confessional statement duly recorded under section 15 of tada would continue to remain admissible as far the other offences under a c e 94 supreme court reports 2001 supp 5 c any other law which too were tried along with tada offences no matter that the accused was acquitted of offences under tada in that trial the court observed that it was undisputed that duly recorded confessional statement is substantive evidence in the trial of offences under ada evidentiary value of such confessional statements it is true that if the confessional statements are taken as they are accused can be convicted for the offences for which they are charged as the said statements are admissible in evidence and are substantive piece of evidence however considering the facts of the case particularly that the confessional statements were recorded by the police officer during investigation said state ments were not sent to the judicial magistr te forthwith and that after record ing the statements accused were not sent to judicial custody in our opinion unless there is sufficient corroboration to the said statements it is not safe to convict the accused solely on the basis of the confessions therefore we have considered confessional statements with the other evidence connecting the accused with the crime learned senior counsel mr sushi kumar submitted that if we remove the evidence of pw26 from the scene then it is difficult to maintain the conviction of 7 it is his contention that 2 and 6 were knowing each other as per their admission in confessional statements he emphasized minor contradictions and submitted that evidence against 7 is not sufficient to connect him with the crime in our view other evidence as stated above fully corroborates the confessio11al statements and there is no reason to discard the evidence of pw26 learned counsel for 2 suryaran submitted that considering the facts he cannot be held guilty for the offence punishable under section 3 3 oft ada as he had no knowledge that 6 and others were involved in the shoot out at j hospital he further submitted that in any set of circumstances he was compelled and threatened by 7 shamkishore to send the car otherwise he and his family would meet the same fate as that of shailesh it is true that there is no direct evidence that 2 was knowing that 7 had called the car for the purpose of moving out other accused who were involved in the shoot out however from his confessional statement it is apparent that he was not ignorant of the fact that 7 was involved in criminal activities he sought assistance with regard to the no confidence motion which was sought to be moved against him and in return as per his say pappu kalani jayawant dattatray suryarao state shah ll 95 had asked him to help 7 when such help was sought for further as per his own say 6 was introduced to him on 12th all throughout in suspicious manner the official car with police guard was taken from one place to another even after coming to know about the incident on 12th he on 14th along with his car moved the accused from place to place and aided them in moving out of bombay in these circumstances it would be difficult to hold that 2 was not having any knowledge with regard to the fact that 6 and others were involved in shoot out at the jj hospital or that he was not assisting the said culprits is unfortunate that the president of the bhiwandi municipal cor poration who normally would be respected political leader would be party to such heinous acts identification of 6 next question is whether idemification of 6 by pw9 in test identifi cation parade and in the dock could be relied upon for convicting him for appreciating this contention it is to be stated that witness has specifically mentioned that 6 was around 5 8 in height and having fair complexion and was well built same is the version of pw12 laxman vi she and pw26 ramcsh patil who had seen 6 while sitling in the car of 2 on 12th and 14th apart from the contradictions here and there learned counsel appearing for 6 vehemently submitted that no reliance can be placed upon the iden tification of 6 by this witness because the incident of firing must have happened within few minutes and in that set of circumstances it is difficult for witness to identify the person wtio fired shots it is also contended that test identificatjon parade held on 22 10 1993 e after more than one year cannot be relied upon as corroborative evidence f no doubt it is true that incident of firing must have happened within few minutes at the same time it is the say of pw9 that he saw 6 thrice once when he tried to come in the room from northern gate again when he came from southern gate and finally when he entered the room and fired shots indiscriminately further considering the nature of duty of police constable there is no reason to doubt his statement we would also reiterate that substan tive evidence of witness is his evidence in court identification parade is not primarily meant for the court but is meant for investigation purposes it serves two purposes namely to enable the witness to satisfy that prisoner whom he q 96 supreme court reports 2001 supp 5 c a suspects is really the one who was seen by him in connection with the com mission of the crime and for satisfying the investigating authority that suspect is the real person whom the witness had seen in connection with the said occurrence in case when the evidence is cogent consistent and without any motive it is no use to theoretically imagine that as the witness has seen the accused for few minutes it would be difficult for him to identify it always depends upon one capacity to recapitulate what he has seen earlier power of perception and memorising differs from man to man and also depends upon situation finally appreciation of such evidence would depend upon the strength and trustworthiness of witnesses re rameshwar singh state of j air 1972 sc 102 suraj pal state of haryana 1995 2 scc 64 daya singh state of hwyana 2001 3 scc 468 in the present case as stated pw9 was the police constable who was present in the room he was injured he saw accused no 6 coming in the room thrice and firing indiscrimi nately and hence there is no reason to doubt identification by him e g the learned counsel for accused no 6 contended that considering the evidence against him it is doubtful whether he fired at shailesh haldankar and other two police constables because he was accompanied by other injured accused pradhan who was also having similar weapon and had fired it is also submitted that pradhan was having bullet injury as per the prosecution version and therefore it would be difficult to arrive at the definite conclusion that identification of a6 by pw9 is reliable to meet this contention it has been pointed out that complexion of absconding accused pradhan was different from that of a6 for this purpose reliance is placed upon the evidence of pw48 dr mukund karia and pw49 dr rajendra thakare pw47 madhukaryadavrao shirsat of athavaline police station sural recorded the statement of injured pradhan at surat and he also described pradhan as having 5 6 height medium built and of shallow complexion pw48 dr karia who had examined pradhan at about 2 30 to 2 45 m on 14 9 1992 at the residence of dr kamble at sural has also described the patient as 28 30 years of age having 5 6 height shallow complexion thin built same is the version of pw49 dr rajendra thakare who retrieved 2 em long bullet from the body of pradhan as against this it has come on record that height of 6 was around 5 8 he was of fair complexion and well built and that is what has been stated by pw9 pw12 and pw26 therefore it would be difficult to hold that pw9 has conunitted any error or mistake in identifying 6 jayawant daitatray suryarao state shah 97 validity of sanction b mr sushi kumar learned senior counsel for accused no 7 submitted that sanction granted by the commissioner of police is without application of mind and thereby illegal for proving sanction the prosecution has relied upon the evidence of pw72 satish sahni who at the relevant time was commis sioner of police mumbai he has specitkally stated that after necessary scrutiny of the papers sanction to prosecute as per ex 266 was granted in detail cross examination he has clarified that he arrived at definite conclu sion for according sanction after perusing the papers and report of the chief p covering the legal aspects and the report of the additional commissioner of police he has also clarified that incident was certainly designed to spread a wave of terror in the minds of the people by indiscriminate firing with lethal weapons in place like hospital sanction order ex 266 also recites that relevant material was perused by him and thereafter he accorded sanction under section 20 2 of the ada for the offences committed by the accused under section 3 2 3 3 3 4 3 5 3 6 5 and 6 of tada similar is the sanction order ex 286 dated 5 8 1993 both these orders are exhaustive and relevant material is referred to hence it cannot be said that there is any illegality or irregularity in granting sanction to prosecute the accused under the provisions oftada from the aforesaid discussion we arrive at the conclusion that 1 learned designated judge has rightly tried and convicted the accused for the offences punishable under the ada there is no substance in the contentions raised by the learned counsel for lhe accused that the shoot out at the j hospital was mere an act of gang rivalry shoot out at the j hospital which is government hospital of 1500 beds in mumbai at midnight causing death of three persons and injuries to six others was in the facts of the present case is nothing but an act of terrorism it cannot be termed as simple act of gang rivalry it is true that it is difficult to define terrorism in precise terms whether the criminal violent act was committed with intent to strike terror in people or section or people would always depend upon facts of each case for finding out the intention of the accused there would hardly be any case where there could be direct evidence 98 supreme court reports 2001 supp 5 c it is to be inferred from the manner and mode adopted while committing the act and its after effect including fear psychosis from the circumstances in the present case irresistible inference can be drawn that crime was committed to create terror and also to take revenge such act creates terror in the minds of the people or section of the people so that the targeted persons would succumb to the dictates or extortion because of fear for survival in the present case psi who was on duty resigned from his job suffered mental depre sion spent sleepless nights and worried about the safety of his family after lapse of seven years of incident retired army officer deposing before the court ap peared to be scared and started weeping in the witness box effect of fear psychosis also can be seen from the statement of president of bhiwandi municipal corporation accused that he was compelled to use his official vehicle along with police constable for the movement of the accused in such cases we should accept the ground reality that it would hardly be possible to get evidence of eye witnesses 2 confessional statement before the police officer under section 15 of the tada is substantive evidence and it can be relied upon in the trial of such person or co accused abettor or conspirator for an offence punishable under the act or the rules the police officer before recording the confession has to observe the re quirement of sub section 2 of section 15 irregularities here and there would not make such confessional statement inadmis sible in evidence if the legislature in its wisdom has provided after considering the situation prevailing in the society that such confessional statement can be used as evidence it would not be just reasonable and prudent to water down the scheme of the act on the assumption that the said statement was recorded under duress or was not recorded truly by the concerned officer in whom faith is reposed it is true that there may be some cases where the power is misused by the concerned authority but such contention can be raised in almost all cases and it would be for the court to decide to what extent the said statement is to be used ideal goal may be confessional statement is made by the accused as repentance for his crime but for achieving such ideal b d f h jayawantdatiatray suryarao state shah 1 99 goal there must be altogether different atmosphere in the society hence unless fool proof method is evolved by the society or such atmosphere is created there is no alternative but to imple ment the jaw as it is 3 sanction to prosecute under tada granted by the competent authority cannot be said to be in any way illegal or erroneous 4 confessional statements of a2 a6 and 7 are corroborated by the confessional statements of other accused as dis cussed by the designated judge by the evidence ofpw 12 laxman vishe and pw26 ramesh patil there is no reason to disbelieve the evidence of pw9 who himself is an injured witness and who was police constable on duty in ward no l8 for the deceased shailesh haldankar he got bullet injury at the relevant time there is no reason to disbelieve the identification of 6 by him description given by him gets full corroboration from evidence of pw12 pw26 and pw42 psi thakur evidence of pw25 girish singh pw 17 tambe and that of pw37 dr sontakke corroborates the version of 2 with regard to movement of car on 12th and 14th as well as asking driver tambe to go out of city as directed by 7 because police was making enquiry about movement of car the evidence with regard to logbook and tearing of two pages also reveals guihy consciousness of 2 hence in our view the designated court was fully justified in convict ing the a2 a6 and a7 and we uphold the same sentence regarding 2 d f learned counsel for 2 submitted that accused has undergone more than six years of imprisonment and considering the fact that he was required 100 supreme court reports 2001 supp 5 c to send the cars under threat sentence may be reduced to the sentence already undergone in our view this submission also does not merit any consideration may be that 2 is political leader or that there may be some threat or compulsion in using his official vehicle for moving the accused from one place to another but that would hardly be ground for reducing the sentence as responsible citizen he ought to have informed the concerned police authori ties to this learned counsel for 2 submitted that when the police faikd to give protection to the person who was in custody it would be difficult to imagine that police would have iven such protection to him or could have saved him from the wrath of the gangsters in our view it is difficult to hold that police would not have given necessary assistance to 2 who was presi dent of bhiwandi municipal corporation the citizens are not supposed to help the criminals on the assumption that in case of need police would not come to their rescue and should succumb to illegal demands of the gangsters regarding 7 learned senior counsel mr sushi kumar submitted that there was no reason to impose sentence of 10 years ri to 7 while the designated court has imposed sentence of 7 years ri to 2 in our view considering the activities carried out by 7 as confessed by him it cannot be said that sentence imposed by the learned judge is in any way excessive or discriminatory from the role played by 7 it is clear that he was vitally involved at his instance on 12th and 14th 2 was compelled to bring the cars ofbhiwandi nagarpalika that too with the police guard for giving treatment to injured accused and for facilitating further to move from one place to another considering the over whelming evidence against 7 particularly the evidence of pw26 and con fessional statements it cannot be said that learned judge has committed any error in convicting 7 and sentencing him to suffer ri for 10 years regarding 6 death reference case no of 2000 b d f learned counsel for 6 submitted that if we take confessional statement as it is then it is apparent that he has not taken parr in shoot out it is his say that after going to the hospital as brijeshsingh knocked the door and none opened and at that time he felt that there was no setting and he asked brijeshsingh that all should go back during that time brijeshsingh fired 3 jayawant daitatray suryarao state shah 101 4 times from his ak 47 rifle on the closed door again he asked brijeshsingh to go back from that place meantime someone else fired at them from the opposite door subsequently brijeshsingh came towards him quickly and informed that he has killed all the persons inside the ward and asked them to move from that place it is the contention of the learned counsel that on the basis of this statement which is substantive evidence brought on record by the prosecution this would not be fit case of sentencing the accused to death in our view there is force in the aforesaid submission accused no 6 who has confessed his involvement in the crime including the crimes commit ted by him previously has specifically stated that he asked brijeshsingh to go back from the hospital without firing he has not confessed that he has fired any shot during the incident in this set of circumstances even though we hold that it was an act of terrorism committed by the accused this would not be fit case for imposing death sentence however considering the confessional statement as whole coupled with the other evidence and the terror created by the accused we confirm the conviction but modify the sentence from death penalty to imprisonment for life till rest of life in subhash chander krishan lal and ors 2001 4 scc 458 the court referred to the decision in state of p ratan singh 1976 3 scc 470 and held that sentence of imprisonment for life does not automatically expire at the end of 20 years including the remissions the court in ratan singh case has observed that 4 as regards the first point namely that the prisoner could be released automatically on the expiry of 20 years under the punjab jail manual or the rules framed under the prisons act the matter is no longer res integra and stands concluded by decision of this court in gopal vinayak godse state of maharashtra 1961 3 scr 440 where the court following decision of the privy council in pandit kishori lal king emperor lr 72 la 1 air 1945 pc 64 observed as follows under that section person transported for life or any other term before the enactment of the said section would be treated as person sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for life or for the said term g 102 b d f supreme court reports 2001j supp 5 c if so the next question is whether there is any provision of law whereunder sentence for life imprisonment without any formal remission by appropriate government can be automati cally treated as one for definite period no such provision is found in the indian penal code code of criminal procedure or the prisons act sentence of transportation for life or imprisonment for life must prima facie be treated as transportation or imprisonment for 1e whole of the remaining period of the convicted person natural life the court further observed thus but the prisons act does not confer on any authority power to commute or remit sentences it provides only for the regulation of prisons and for the treatment of prisoners confined therein section 59 of the prisons act confers power on the state government to make rules inter alia for rewards for good conduct therefore the rules made under the act should be con strued within the scope of the ambit of the act under the said rules th orders of an appropriate government under section 401 criminal procedure code are pre requisite for release no other rule has been brought to our notice which confers an inde feasible right on prisoner sentenced to transportation for life to an unconditional release on the expiry of particular term in eluding remissions the rules under the prisons act do not sub stitute lesser sentence for sentence of transportation for life the question of remission is exclusively within the prov ince of the appropriate government and in this case it is admit ted that though the appropriate government made certain remis sions under section 401 of the code of criminal procedure it did not remit the entire sentence we therefore hold that the peti tioner has not yet acquired any right to release similarly in shri bhagwan state of rajasthan 20011 6 scc 296 the jay want datta tray suryarao state shah 103 court relied upon the decision in ratan singh case supra and observed as under a question may arise whether in view of the provision of section 433 read with section 433 cr c an accused should be released on completion of 14 years of imprisonment for this purpose we would make it clear that under section 433 enables the appro priate government to commute the sentence of imprisonment for life for imprisonment of term not exceeding 14 years or for fine under section 433 there is an embargo on that power by providing that where sentence of imprisonment for life is imposed on conviction of person for an offence for which death is one of the punishments provided under the law such person is not to be released from prison unless he had served at least fourteen years of imprisonment this question is considered by various decisions rendered by this court and by the privy council and it has been reiterated that sentence of imprisonment for life imposed prima facie be treated as imprisonment for the whole of the remaining period of the convicted person natural life it is also established law that rules framed under the prisons act do not substitute lesser sentence for sentence of transportation for life similar are the observations of this court in sohan lal asha ram and ors 1981 1 scc 106 bhagirath delhi administration 1985 2 scc 580 and in zahid hussein and ors state of b and am 2001 3 scc 750 in this case also considering the heinous act of terrorism and brutal murder of two police constables who were on duty to guard shailesh haldankar even though we hold this would not be fit case for imposing death sentence we direct that accused will not be entitied to any commutation or pre mature release under section 433 of criminal procedure code prisoners act jail manual or any other statute and the rules made for the purpose of commutation and remissions in the result criminal appeal no 975 of 2000 filed by accused no 2 jayawant dattatray suryarao criminal appeal no 956 of 2000 filed by ac cused no 7 shamkishore shamsharma garikapatti are dismissed and criminal appeal no 966 of 2001 filed by accused no 6 subhashsingh shobhanathsingh h 104 2001 supp 5 c a thakur is partly allowed as stated above death reference case no of 2000 supreme court reports stands disposed of accordingly criminal appeal no 101 of 2000 c considering the evidence

hospital and not against the director personally and therefore there was no locus standi for the respondent to file the complaint trial court upholding the said contention discharged the appellant however on appeal high court reversed the order of trial court and restored the 934 jo x john thomas dr jagadeesan 935 criminal proceeding holding that the respondent director had locus standi to file the complaint and that the trial court in summons cases instituted on complaints cannot discharge the accused after passing over the stage of evidence hence the present appeal dismissing the appeal the court held 1 1 the complainant being director of the hospital which is private limited company would fall within the purview of some persons aggrieved as envisaged in section 199 1 of the code of criminal procedure 1973 941 aj 1 2 the collocation of the words by some persons aggrieved in section 199 1 of the code definitely indicates that th omplainant need not necessarily be the defamed person himself if comp ny or firm is described in publication as engaging itself in nefarious activities its impact would certainly fall on every director of the company or every working partner of the firm as the case may be and hence they can legitimately feel the pinch of it 940 il 2 after reading th imputations in the instant case there is no doubt that they are prima facie libellous the only effect of an imputation being per se defamatory is that it would relieve the complainant of the burden to establish that the publication of such imputations has lowered him in the estimation of the right thinking members of the public however even if the imputation is not per se defamatory that by itself would not go to the advantage of the publisher for the complaining person can establish on evidence that the publication has in fact amounted to defamation even in spite of the apparent deficiency appellant cannot contend that he is entitled to discharge on the ground that the imputations in the extracted publications were not per se defamatory 939 940 b 3 section 25b of the code has no application to cases instituted upon complaints summons cases are generally of two categories those instituted upon complaints and those instituted otherwise than upon complaints section 258 of the code is intended to cover those cases belonging to one category alone e summons cases instituted otherwise than upon complaints the section permits the court to acquit the accused prematurely only in those summons cases instituted otherwise than on complaints wherein the evidence of material witjjesses was recorded since the instant case was instituted on complaint the endeavour made by the accused to find help from section 258 g 936 supreme court reports 2001 3 c a of the code is of no avail 939 f 4 in the instant case appellant has neither pleaded before the trial court nor before the high court that there was no necessary averments in the complaint regarding his role in

criminal appellate jurisdiction criminal appeal no 688 of 2001 from the judgment and order dated 3 4 2001 of the madras high court in crl p no 241 95 shivasubramanium and ms lily isabel thomas for the appellant the judgment of the court was deiivered by 0 thomas leave granted d renowned hospital in the metropolis of madras chennai has been caricatured in newspaper as the abattoir of human kidneys for trafficking purposes when the director of the hospital complained of defamation the publisher of the newspaper sought shelter under the umbrage that the libel is not against the director personally but against the hospital only and hence he cannot feel aggrieved the accused publisher who raised the objection before the trial court on being summoned by the court to appear before it succeeded in stalling the progress of the trial by clinging to the said contention which the trial magistrate has upheld but the high court of madras disapproved the action of e magistrate and directed the trial to proceed hence the accused has come up to this court by filing the special leave petition but after hearing the learned senior counsel who argued for the appellant we did not find the necessity to wait for the respondent complainant to reply to those arguments as the appeal is only liable to be dismissed in limine the complainant respondent in this stated that he is running hospital as its director under the name j hospital he claimed to be the honorary overseer ad iser of royal college of physicians and surgeons qf glasgow in uk his grievance in the complaint is that news item was published by i john thomas dr jagadeesan thomas 937 the madras times on 21 3 1991 containing highly defamatory imputations against his hospital the said newspaper is daily published and circulated by the appellant as its editor the passage which according to the complainant is defamatory to him has been quoted in the complaint it is extracted below it is stated that the hospital used to stealthily deprive of its patients of one of their kidneys when they were admitted for minor operations women who were admitted for caesarian operation had one of their kidneys removed without their knowledge more than 120 women have so far been affected by this trading in kidneys it is reported that the kidneys were later exported to malaysia the hospital has engaged brokers to the lure in the needy poor to part with one of their kidneys for hefty sum the nefarious activity has been going on for many months now so the complaint was filed by the respondent before the court of metropolitan magistrate for the offence under section 500 of the ipc the magistrate who took cognizance of the offence issued process to the appellant it seems the appellant is interested in taking up his defence and contentions only in piecemeal manner at the first instance he approached the high court for quashing the complaint on the ground that the magistrate ought to have examined all the witnesses for the complainant before issuing the process to the accused the high court dismissed his petition and repelled his contention on that score as per an order passed in crl p no 2189 93 thereafter the appellant moved the trial court for discharging him from the proceedings for which he raised two other contentions the first among them is that the publication did not amount to defamation second among them is that j hospital is private limited company whereas the complainant is private individual who had no locus standi to file the complaint f on the first contention the trial magistrate found that the imputations are derogatory remarks about the hospital the learned magistrate upheld the second contention for which he made the following observations even though the respondent himself admits in his complaint that dr jagadeesan is the director of j hospital mere admission by the complainant cannot give him the status of director of the hospital without the article of association duly registered in the company ljw board under indian companies act therefore onus is on the respondent to ppove that he is the director of j hospitaj and he has the locus standi to file this complaint the respondent has not g 938 supreme court reports 2001 3 c discharged the onus that he is the director of j hospital and so he has failed to prove that he has locus standi in filing the complaint against the petitioner the trial magistrate on the above reasoning discharged the appellant as per its order dated 10 2 1995 the complainant filed revision before the high court of madras challenging the aforesaid order of discharge single judge of the high court reversed the order and restored the criminal proceedings to reach its logical culmination in accordance with law it is the said order of the high court which the appellant accused is challenging now the learned single judge noticed that the trial court has already recorded evidence of two witnesses for the prosecution he did not consider the points found against by the trial court instead he observed that the trial court in summons case cannot discharge the accused after passing over to the stage of evidence according to the learned single judge the accused should have filed the application for discharge immediately after he ente ed appearance and if he ha not done so he could not do it after the court has moved to the stage of evidence talcing what the learned single judge has stated on that aspect reads as follows if such an application is filed before the court immediately after entering appearance before commencement of the trial as envisaged in chapter xx cr c the petition is maintainable but now the stage has passed and the evidence of two witnesses on the side of prosecution was recorded and at this stage in the absence of any provision for discharge of the accused the magistrate ought not to have discharged tlie accused and he should have allowed the trial to flow in accordance with the established procedure f the appellant questioned the aforesaid view of the learned single judge on the strength of section 258 of the code of criminal procedure for short the code it must be pointed out that the offence under section 500 of the ipc is triable as summons case in accordance with the provisions contained in chapter xx of the code sections 251 to 257 of that chapter deal with the steps to be adopted from the commencement upto culmination of the proceedings in summons cases one of the normal rules in summons cases is that once trial started it should reach its normal culmination but section 258 is included in that chapter in the form of an exception to the aforesaid normal progress chart of the trial in summons cases it is useful to extract the section here john thomas dr jagadeesan thomas 939 258 power to stop proceedings in certain cases in any sumffions case instituted otherwise than upon complaint magistrate of the first class or with the previous sanction of the chief judicial magistrate any other judicial magistrate may for reasons to be recorded by him stop the proceedings at any stage without pronouncing any judgment and where such stoppage of proceedings is made after the evidence of the principal witness has been recorded pronounce judgment of acquittal and in any other case release the accused and such release shall have the effect of discharge summons cases are generally of two categories those instituted upon complaints and those instituted otherwise than upon complaints the latter category would include cases based on police reports section 258 of the code is intended to cover those cases belonging to one category alone e summons cases instituted otherwise than upon complaints he segment separated at the last part of the section by the words and in any other case is only sub category or division consisting of summons cases instituted otherwise than upon complaints that sub category is not intended to cover all summons cases other than those instituted on police report in fact section 258 vivisects only summons cases instituted otherwise than on complaints into two divisions one division consists of cases in which no evidence of material witness was recorded the section permits the court to acquit the accused prematurely only in those summons cases instituted otherwise than on complaints wherein the evidence of material witnesses was recorded but the power of court to discharge an accused at midway stage is restricted to those cases instituted otherwise than on complaints wherein no material witness was examined at all the upshot of the above is that section 258 of the code has no application to cases instituted upon complaints the present is case which was instituted on complaint hence the endeavour made by the accused to find help from section 258 of the code is of no tvail shri siva subramaniam learned senior counsel for the appellant contended that the imputations contained in the publication complained of are not per se defamatory after reading the imputations we have no doubt that they are prima facie libellous the only effect of an imputation being per se defamatory is tha it would relieve the complainant of the burden to establish that the publication of such imputations has lowered him in the estimation of the right thinking members of the public however even if the 940 supreme court reports 200 3 c a imputation is not per se defamatory that by itself would not go to the advantage of the publisher for the complaining person can establish on evidence that the publication has in fact amounted to defamation even in spite of the apparent deficiency so the appellant cannot contend at this stage that he is entitled to discharge on the ground that the imputations in the extracted publication were not per se defamatory the contention focused by the learned senior counsel is that the respondent who filed the complaint has no locus standi to complain because he is only director of j hospital about which the publication was made and that the publication did not contain any libel against the complainant personally it is not disputed that the complainant is the director of j hospital explanation 2 in section 499 of the ipc reads thus explanation 2 it may amount to defamation to make an imputation concerning company or an association or collection of persons as such in view of the said explanation it cannot be disputed that publication containing defamatory imputations as against company would escape from the purview of the offence of defamation if the defamation pertains to an association of persons or body corporate who could be the complainant this can be answered by reference to section 199 of the code the first sub e section of that section alone is relevant in this context it reads thus 99 prosecution for defamation 1 no court shall take cognizance of an offence under chapter xxi of the indian penal code 45 of 1860 except upon complaint made by some person aggrieved by the offence the collocation of the words by some persons aggrieved definitely indicates that the complainant need not necessarily be the defamed person himself whether the complainant has reason to feel hurt on account of the publication is matter to be determined by the court depending upon the facts of each case if company is described as engaging itself in nefarious activities its impact would certainly fall on every director ofthe company and hence he can legitimately feel the pinch of it similarly if firm is described in publication as carrying on offensive trade every working partner of the firm can reasonably be expected to feel aggrieved by it if j hospital is private limited ompany it is too farfetched to rule out any one of its directors feeling aggrieved on account of pejoratives hurled at the company hence the john thomas 1 dr jagadeesan thomas 941 appellant cannot justifiably contend that the director of the j hospital would not fall within the wide purview of some person aggrieved as envisaged in section 199 1 of the code the learned senior counsel made last attempt to save the appellant from prosecution on the strength on the decision of this court in km mathew state of kera 1992 1 sec 217 in that case prosecution against chief editor was quashed for want of necessary averments in the complaint regarding his role in the publication that part of the decision rests entirely on the facts of that case and it cannot be imported to this case it is pertinent to point out in this context that the appellant did not have any such point either when he first moved the high court for quashing the proceedings or when he moved the trial ourt for discharge hence it is too late in the day for raising any such point even apart from non availability of that defence to the appellant on merits we therefore dismiss this appeal v appeal dismissed '], [' bandhua mukti morcha etc union of india

prohibition on employment of children below 14 years and directing the respondents to give them facilities like education health sanitation nutritious food etc j bandhuamukti morchav o 381 the main contention of the petitioner group is that employment of the children in any indust or in hazardous industry is violative of article 24 of the constitution and derogatory to the mandates contained in articles 39 and 45 of the constitution read with the preamble pursuant to the filing of the writ petition this court appointed prem bhai and others to visit factories manufacturing carpets and to submit their findings as to whether any number of children below the age of 14 years are working in the carpet industry etc the commissioner submitted his preliminary report subsequently by order dated august 1 1991 this court appointed committee consisting of shri p vergese ms gyansudha mishra and dr p raju to go around mirzapur area and other places where carpets are being weaved to find out whether children are being exploited and to submit comprehensive report in furtherance thereof comprehensive report was submitted on november 18 1991 the matter was heard and arguments were concluded the judgment was reserved by proceedings dated october 18 1994 since the judgment could not be delivered the matter was directed to be posted before bench consisting of saghir ahmad we have heard the counsel on both sides the primary contention by the petitioner on behalf of the children below the age of 14 years is that the employment of children by various carpet weavers in varanasi mirzapur jaunpur and allahabad areas is violative of article 24 the report of the committee discloses the enormity of the problem of exploitation to which the children are subjected children ranging between 5 to 12 years having been kidnapped from the village chhichhori patna block district palamau in bihar in january and february 1984 in three batches and were taken to village bilwari in mirzapur district of p for being engaged in carpet weaving centres they are forced to work all the day virtaally they are being treated as slaves and are subjected to physical torture revealed by the presence of marks of violence on their person the commission committee visited 42 villages and found in all 884 looms engaging 42 of the work force with the children below the age of 14 years the total number of children are 369 95 of them are of tender age ranging between 6 to 11 years and most of them belong to the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes despite pursuation they could not be released and continue to languish under bondage the commission visited several villages personally contacted the parents of the children in different places and found that the children were taken against their wishes and are wrongfully forced to work as bonded 382 supreme court reports 1997 2 c a labour in the carpet industries they have furnished the list of the children whom they contacted and the list of the carpet industries whereat the children were found engaged the question therefore is whether the employment of the children below the age of 14 years is violative of article 24 and whether the omission on the part of the state to provide welfare facilities and opportunities deprives them of the constitutional mandates contained in articles 45 39 and 21 14 etc child of today cannot develop to be responsible and productive member of tomorrow society unless an environment which is conducive to his social and physical health is assured to him every nation developed or deyeloping links its future with the status of the child childhood holds the potential and also sets the limit to the future development of the society children are the greatest gift to the humanity mankind has best hold of itself the parents themselves live for them they embody the joy of life in them and in the innocence relieving the fatigue and drudgery in their struggle of daily life parents regain peace and happiness in the company of the children the children signify eternal optimism in the human being and always provide the potential for human development if the children are better equipped with broader human output the society will feel happy with them neglecting the children means loss to the society as whole if children are deprived of their childhood socially economi cally physically and mentally the nation gets deprived of the potential human resources for social progress economic empowerment and peace and order the social stability and good citizenry the founding fathers of the constitution therefore have emphasised the importance of the role of the and the need of its best development dr bhim rao ambedker who was far ahead of his time in his wisdom projected these rights in

article 45 mandates that the state shall en deavour to provide free and compulsory education for all children until they compiete the age of 14 years the period of ten years provided therein has lost

mine or engaged in any other hazardous employment article 21 mandates that no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to the procedure established by law which this

poor weaker sections dalit and tribes and minorities enjoy the childhood and develop its full blossomed personality educationally intel lectually and culturally with spirit of inquiry reform and

bench 3 the petitioners in their applications before this court have alleged that they were allowed by the respondents to transact their business by occupying particular area on the pavements on payment of certain charges described as tehbazar it is contended that the municipal authorities by their refusal to permit the petitioners to con tinue with their trade are violating their fundamental right guaranteed under article 19 1 and 21 of the constitution they have also 1044 supreme court reports 1989 3 c a complained of ma fides arbitrariness and discriminatory conduct attracting article 14 of the constitution 4 the respondents besides denying the facts alleged by the petitioners contended that nobody has got legal right to occupy exclusively particular area on the road pavements for pursuing trading business and nobody can claim any fundamental right in this regard whatsoever it has been strenuously urged that the roads are meant for the use of general public for passing and re passing and they are not laid to facilitate the carrying on of private business 5 the main argument on behalf of the petitioners was addressed by mr tarkunde who appeared for petitioner sodan singh in lp no 15257 of 1987 several learned advocates representing the other petitioners besides adopting the main argument made brief supple mentary submissions the place where petitioner sodan singh claims to have the right to squat for soiling ready made garments is within new delhi several other petitioners have similar claims against the new delhi municipal committee the remaining petitioners allege that they have been pursuing their squatting business within delhi as defined in the delhi municipal corporation act which is adminis tered by the respondent municipal corporation of delhi separate arguments have been made on behalf of the new delhi municipal committee and the municipal corporation of delhi f h 6 mr tarkunde urged that petitioner sodan singh is poor hawker making his both ends meet by selling ready made garments on an area of 8 24 near electric pole no 12 janpath lane new delhi as illustrated in the attached map annexure to the petition earlier he was permitted to hawk from time to time by the respondent under licences as per annexure 2 but now the privilege is being denied to him and his goods were removed forcibly from the pavement and were later released only on payment of cost of removal charges in the counter affidavit of the respondent the allegations have been denied and it has been pointed out that the photo copy of the licence annexure 2 itself shows that the petitioner was permitted to sell channa and moongphali on vehngi on and around bus stop no 430 on pt pant marg and he was at no point of time allowed to occupy fixed place for carrying on business in ready made garments we do not propose to go into the facts of this or the other petitions and would leave the individual cases to be dealt with by the division bench in the light of the general principle which will be discussed in this judgment 1 sodan singh n m sharma 1045 7 the municipal corporation of delhi was established by a notification issued under 3 of the delhi municipal corporaiiori aci 1957 and ihe provisions of that act are relevant for the majority of the present cases the other cases relate to ihe other areas fofiniii part of the union territory of delhi governed by the provisions of the punjab municipal act 1911 however ihe main submissions iri aii ihese cases made on behalf of both sides have been with respeci ill the general pririeiples applicable in india about the right to carry on business by squatting on pavements of public streets 8 mr tarkunde contended that the peiiiioi iers afe poof peopie arid depend on their business for their livelihood if they ate iiti allowed tb occupy some specific plilce for conductillg their biisiiiess tbey may starve this will lead to violatitiri of their fiillclahieiiiai fight tillder article 21 of the tohstitution reliance was placed ori the ded sioh iii olga tellis and thers bombay municipal corporation and others 1985 3 sec 545 the learned counsel further said that the two respondents have been in the past allowing squatter traders on the pavements on payment of tehbazari charges he drew our attention tb the counter affidavit of the respondent in l nos 4519 23 of 1986 at riage 146 where resolution by the new delhi municipal committee has been mentioned ih paragraph iil in the case of delhi municipal corporation also several documents have been relied upon for show ing that specific areas have been allowed to be occupied for the purpose of trading business from time to time the learned counsel argued that since the two municipalities have been settling specific areas for the purpose of squatting it is not open to them to deny squatting rights to the petitioners and other persons situated in similar circumstarices 9 in pyare lal etc n m 1967 3 scr 747 the new delhi municipal committee banned the sale of cooked edibles on public streets and prevented the petitioners licensed vendors of potato chops and other edibles from continuing with their business after sticcessfully moving the punjab high court they came to this court the appeals were dismissed holding that persons in ihdia can not claim lawful right to pursue street trading and the d c was perfectly authorised to take steps under 173 of the punjab municipal act for stopping the business it was also observed that the d c was not empowered under ihe act to aliow trade oh pulilic streets on permanent basis and that permission for sale of goods could be granted only on special occasions on temporary basis as in ihe case of festivals etc reliance had been placed on behalf of the 1046 supreme court reports 1989 3 c a petitioners on certain passages from halsbury laws of england which the court distinguished on the ground that street trading was regulated by certain statutes in england and there were no such provi sions applicable in the cases before this court the right to pursue street trading in india was thus negatived mr tarkunde contended that it is not correct to deny the members of the public their right to engage in business on the public streets in the country he said that this is one of the fundamental rights guaranteed both under article 19 g and article 21 according to the learned counsel the practice of the street trading is well established for considerable time in all the civilised countries of the world including india england and united states of america refuting the suggestion made on behalf of the respondents that it was only hawker who sells his goods while moving from door to door and place to place who is allowed on the public streets mr tarkunde referred to halsbury laws of england vol 40 paragraphs 431 to 446 under the heading street trading in greater london it was suggested that the right of the members of the public in this regard was founded on the common law right the learned counsel further relied on the third paragraph of 253 of the chapter highways streets and bridges of 39 american jurispru dence 2nd edition which reads as follows d municipality power to regulate the use of streets for private gain is to be liberally construed the purpose of such regulations is to promote public safety and not to regulate and control indirectly the user business as such there is no authority in municipality to prohibit the use of the street by any citizen or corporation in the carrying on of legitimate business harmless in itself and useful to the community which is independent of the police power under which reasonable regulations in the promotion of the public order safety health and welfare are proper 10 in his reply mr singhvi the learned counsel for d c pointed out that the first two paragraphs of the aforementioned 253 which are quoted below negative the right asserted on behalf of the petitioners and paragraph 3 mentioned above has to be read in that light 253 business purposes individuals do not have the inherent right to conduct their private business in the streets nor can they acquire e g f sodan singh n m sharma 1047 vested right to use the streets for carrying on commercial business however individuals do have the right to use the streets to some extent for the purpose of bartering or trad ing with each other or for prosecuting business trade or calling although they cannot legally carry on any part of their business in the public streets to the annoyance of the public or supply the deficiencies in their own premises by monopolizing the street or walk b the use of public streets as place for the prosecu tion of private business for gain is generally recognised as special or extraordinary use which the controlling public authority may prohibit or regulate as it deems proper when municipality does permit private individuals to have exclusive possession of the street surface for private business use such permit is so unusual and beyond the ordinary authority and power of municipality that it may not issue such permit in the absence of special enabling state legislation assuming that such power exists the granting of permission to private person to so use the streets is totally within the discretion of the municipality d the learned counsel contended that the grant of exclusive right to occupy any part of the road amounts to the negation of the common law theory of dedication of road for public use 11 reference was also made on behalf of the petitioners to the judgment in a pal mohd r sadarangani lr 1985 madras 23 wherein it was observed that hawker trade so long as it is proper regulated by public authorities could never be public nuisance rather it serves the convenience of the public and is found not only in india but also in other countries 12 the question of applicability of the el glish and american laws on the present aspect was considered by division bench of the madras high court in s motor service madras state lr 1953 madras 279 and the decision was later approved by this court in saghir ahmad the state of p and others 1955 1 scr 707 after thorough consideration of the relevant materials venkatarama aiyar who delivered the judgment pointed out some of the basic differences in the law of this country on the present subject from the american and english laws which render the american decisions inapplicable on certain aspects the right to carry on business h 1048 supreme court reports 1989 3 c although recognised as one of the liberties protected by the american constitution did not acquire the full status of the freedoms expressly mentioned in the constitution such as the freedom of speech of person and of religion and was viewed somewhat i11 the light of an interloper or parvenu among them the freedoms expressly mentioned in the american constitution occupy an exalted position which was denied to the unexpressed freedoms including the right to carry on business under the indian constitution this right is one of the free doms expressly protected under article 19 g and is placed on the same tbdiing as freedom bf speech etc further only some trades could be ilri ied on by the american citizens as matter of right and the otliers including the transport business dn public roads only if the state perfuiited the learned judge observed that this is called franchise bf privilege and has an english origin that is riot the case in this cdilri ry inasrrillch as article 19 1 does not make any distinction frorri trade to trade so far englarid is concerned the rights of citizens to public pathways originated in feudal times when the lands were owned by individuais the public highways generally pass through these larids and since the citizens were using these roads the law inferred dedication of the pathways by the owners for user by the public but the extent of this user was limited to the passing and re passing on the road the position in india has always remained somewhat different and has been summarized in paragraph 24 of the judgment of venkatarama aiyar in the following terms which has been quoted with appro by this court in saghir ahmad case b d r the true position then is that all public streets and roads vest in the state but that the state holds them as trustee on behalf of the public the members of the public are entitled as beneficiaries to use them as matter of right and this right is limited only by the similar rights possessed by every other citizen to use the pathways the state as trustees on behalf of the public is entitled to impose all such limitations on the character and extent of the user as may be requisite for protecting the rights of the public gener ally thus the nature of the road may be such that it may not be suitable for heavy traffic and it will be within the competence of the legislature to limit the use of the streets to vehicles which do not exceed specified size or weight such regulations have been held to be valid as within the police power of the state in america vide morris budy 1927 71 law ed 968 sproles bindfo 19321 76 law ed 1167 and south carolina state barnwell 1 l sodan singh n m sharma 1049 bros 1938 82 law ed 734 for the same reason the state might even prohibit the running of transport buses and lorries on particular streets or roads if such running would interfere with the rights of pedestrians to pass and re pass as it might if the street is narrow or conjested but subject to such limitations the right of citizen to carry on business in transport vehicles on public pathways cannot be denied to him on the ground that the state owns the highways 1 13 mr singh vi is correct in pointing out that the passages of the american and english laws as relied upon on behalf of the peti 1 tioners do not establish their right to carry on trading business on public streets but for that reason their claim cannot be rejected either the question requires to be examined further the observations in the judgment of venkatarama aiyer quoted above primafacie support the petitioners they received express approval of this court in saghir ahmad case but there is an important distillction between those cases and the present matter which cannot be ignored in both the above cases the petitioners were claiming the right to ply transport vehicles for hire on public streets in other words they wanted to use the roads for transport for which the roads were primarily laid out and while so doing attempted to earn money in the present cases before us the petitioners are desirous of conducting their trade business by sale of goods on the roads from stationary points they do not want to make use of the roads for movement of persons or goods the question is whether this makes material difference 14 the primary object of building roads is undoubtedly to facili tate people to travel from one point to another quoting several authorities byron elliott and william elliott in their treatise on the law of roads and streets have defined street as road or public way in city town or village way over land set apart for public travel in town or city is street no matter by what name it may be called if way is free to all people it is highway duraisw ami aiyangar in his book dealing with the law of municipal corporation in british india 1914 edn has observed that the primary and paramount use of the street is public travel for man beast and carriage for goods on behalf of the respondents reliance has been placed on the oft repeated adage that public have right of passing and re passing through street but have no right to be on it which sri aiyangar also has mentioned at page 542 of his book halsbury relied upon by both sides has stated vol 21 paragraph 107 that the right of 1050 supreme court reports 1989 3 c a the public ll tjzht to pass alone highway for the

authorities for regulating traffic which will be wholly unpractical the authorities are duty bound to locate post boxes fire hydrants with water tanks milk booths bus or jutka stands rubbish bine etc in appropriate places in public street and it would be reposterous to hold that this cannot be done as somebody may insist on keeping every inch of the street available for actual passage winfield and jolowicz in their book on tort 12th edn have said that nuisance may be defined wit reference to highways as any wrongful act or omission upon or near highw ay whereby the public are pre vented from freely safely and conveniently passing along the highway and that the law requires of users of the highway certaio amount of give and take the case of harper g maden and sons limited 1933 1 ch 298 illustrates this point the defendants there who had their house abutting the road decided to add another floor to their existing premises before starting construction they erected ii ffol resting on the footpath and vut up wooden hoarding sodan singh n m sharma 1051 next door to the plaintiff shop for the purpose of enclosing space to be used during the alterations to their building for

reasonable in quantum and in duration did not give rise to legal remedy it was very well said that ii the law relating to the user of highways is in truth the law of give and take those who use them must in doing so have reasonable regard to the convenience and comfort of others and must not themselves expect degree of ccin venience and comfort only obtainable by disregarding that of other people they must expect to be obstructed occa sionally it is the price they pay for the privilege of obstructing others as to what will constitute public nuisance and what can be included in the legitimate user can be ascertained only by taking into account all the relevant circumstances including the size of the road the amount of traffic and the nature of the additional use one wants to make of the public streets this has to be judged objectively and here coines the role of public authorities i 4 r 16 so far as right of hawker to transact business while going from place to place is concerned it has been admittedly recognised for a long period of course that also is subject to proper regulation in the interest of general convenience of the public including health and security considerations what about the right to squat on the road side for engaging in trading business as was stated by this court in bombay hawkers union and others bombay municipal corporation and others 1985 3 scr 528 the public streets by their nomenclature and definition are meant for the use of the general public they are not laid to facilitate the carrying on of private business if hawkers were to be conceded the right claimed by them they could hold the society to ransom by squatting on the busy thoroughfares thereby paralysing all civic life this is one side of the picture on the other hand if properly regulated according to the exigency of the circumstances the small j 1052 supreme court reports 1989 3 c traders on the said walks can considerably add to the comfort and convenience of general public by making available ordinary articles of every day use for comparatively lesser price an ordinary person not very affluent while hurrying towards his home after day work can pick up these articles without going out of his way to find regular market if the circumstances are appropriate and small trader can do some business for personal gain on the pavement to the advantage of the general public and without any discomfort or annoyance to the others we do not see any objection to his carrying on the business appreciating this analogy the municipalities of different cities and towns in the country have been allowing such traders the right to carry on trade or business mentioned in article 19 g of the con stitution on street pavements if properly regulated cannot be denied on the ground that the streets are meant exclusively for passing or re passing and for no other use proper regulation is however necessary condition as otherwise the very object of laying out roads to facilitate traffic may be defeated allowing the right to trade with out appropriate control is likely to lead to unhealthy competition and quarrel between traders and travelling public and sometimes amongst the traders themselves resulting in chaos the right is subject to reasonable restrictions under clause 6 of article 19 if the matter is examined in this light it will appear that the principle stated in saghir ahmad case in connection with transport business applies to the hawkers case also the proposition that all public streets and roads in india vest in the state but that the state holds them as trustee on behalf of the public and the members of the public are entitled as beneficiaries to use them as matter of right and that this right is limited only by the similar rights possessed by every other citizen to use the pathways and further that the state as trustee is entitled to impose all necessary limitations on the character and extent of the f user should be treated as of universal application 17 the provisions of the municipal acts should be construed in the light of the above proposition in case of ambiguity they should receive beneficial interpretation which may enable the municipali ties to liberally exercise their authority both in granting permission to individuals for making other uses of the pavements and for removal of any encroachment which may in their opinion be constituting undesirable obstruction to the travelling public the provisions of the delhi municipal corporation act 1957 are clear and nobody disputes before us that the municipal corporation of delhi has full authority to permit hawkers and squatters on the side walks when they consider it practical and convenient in so far the punjab municipal act 1911 t 1 1 sodan singh n m sharma 1053 applying to the new delhi area is concerned the bench constituted by three learned judges observed in pyare lal case 1967 3 scr 747 that the provisions did not authorise the municipality to permit stalls to be set up in the streets except temporarily on special occasions like festivals etc and that the permission to the petitioner in that case had been wrongly granted initially we do not agree with these observa tions although it appears that in the light of the other circumstances indicated in the judgment the decision was correct one the provi sions of both ss 173 and 188 should receive liberal construction so that the new delhi municipal committee may be in position to exercise full authority indeed some of the documents on the records before us indicate that the committee had been in the past act11ally permitting hawkers and squatters on pavements in certain areas i k l 18 the controversy in the present cases however cannot be settled by what has been said earlier the claim of the petitioners before us is much higher they assert the right to occupy specific places on road pavements alleging that they have been so doing in the past as has been stated earlier the facts have been disputed and individual cases will be considered separately in the light of the present judgment the argument however which has been pressed on behalf of the petitioners is that they have their fundamental rights guaranteed by articles 19 and 21 of the constitution to occupy specific places demarcated on the pavements on permanent basis for running their business we do not think there is any question of application of article 21 and we will be briefly indicating our reasons therefor later but can there be at all fundamental right of citizen to occupy particular place on the pavement where he can squat and engage in trading business we have no hesitation in answering the issue against the petitioners the petitioners do have the fundamental right to carry on trade or business of their choice but not to do so on particular place the position can be appreciated better in the light of two deci sions of this court in fertilizer corporation kam gar union union of india 1981 2 scr 52 and rajendran state of tamil nadu 1982 3 scr 628 19 in the fertilizer corporation case the workmen of the respondent corporation challenged the legality of the sale of certain plants and equipments of the sindri fertilizer factory inter alia on the ground that large number of workers would be retrenched as result of the le they argued that the sale would deprive them of their fundamental right under article 19 1 to carry on their occupation as industrial wor ers bench of five judges of this court rejected the i 1 1054 supreme court reports 1989 3 c a plea holding that article 19 1 confers broad and general right which is available to all persons to do work of particular kind and of their choice but it does not confer the right to hold particular job or to occupy particular post of one choice the right to pursue calling or to carry on an occupation is not the same thing as the right to work in particular post if the workers were retrenched consequent upon and on account of the sale it would be open to them to pursue their rights and remedies under the labour laws but the closure of an establishment in which workman for the time being was employed did not by itself infringe his fundamental right to carry on an occupa tion which is guaranteed by article 19 g the choice and free dom of the workers to work as industrial workers is not affected by the sale the sale may at the highest affect their locum but it does not affect their locus to work as industrial worker this decision was followed in rajendran state of tamil nadu which arose out of policy decision taken by the state of tamil nadu to abolish all the posts of part time village officers an ordinance was promulgated for this purpose and was later replaced by an act rejecting the appeal of the appellants this court held that the impugned act did not violate article 19 g as it did not affect the right of the incumbents of posts to carry on any occupation of their choice even though they may not be able to stick on to the post which they were holding the ratio of these decisions apply with full force to the cases where the right to pursue trade or business is involved if the opposite view is taken and the plea of the petitioners is allowed chaotic situation may follow they may be entitled to insist that they would carry on their business anywhere they like either on the roads or in the government schools or hospitals or other public buildings they may like to enter the class rooms or the patient wards or any public office to advance their prospects as was observed in the bombay hawkers case 1985 3 scc 528 they can hold the society to ransom by squatting on the busy thoroughfare thereby paralysing all civic life 20 we do not find any merit in the argument founde on article 21 of the constitution in our opinion article 21 is not attracted in case of trade or business either big or small the right to carry on any trade or business and the concept of life and personal liberty within article 21 are too remote to be connected together the case of olga tellis and others bombay municipal corporation and others i985 3 sec 545 heavily relied upon on behalf of the petitioners is clearly distinguishable the petitioners in that case were very poor persons who had made pavements their homes existing in the midst of filth and squalor which had to be seen to be believed rabid dogs in search of h s an sl l9 v d c sharma f 1055 sti king meat and cats in seaq qf hungry rats kept them company they cpoked and cpt where they cased for no conveniences were available to them their daughters oming of age bathed under the nosy of passers by nmindfu of the femi line sens of bash fu ness they d to stay on the pavements so that they could get odd jobs in the city it was not c ise of business of selling articles after investing some capital howsoe er meagre it is significant to note that the judgment in bombay hawkers unwn and others bombay municipal corporutwn anu utlzers 1985 3 scr 528 and that in olga tellis were delivered wnhin week both by v chandrachud cj and some of the counsel appearing two cases were common and hat while dealing with the rights of the squatting hawkers in the former case the learned chief justice confined the consideration of the right under article 9 of the constitution besioes the court in the olga tellis affirmed the validity of 3 i4 of the bombay municipal corporation act on the ground that removal of encroachments on the footpaths or pave ments over which the public has the right of passage or access cannot be regarded as unreasonable unfair or unjust 4 in this connection the court further proceeded to say footpaths or pavements are public properties which are intended to serve the convenience of the general public they are not laid for private use and indeed their use for private purpose frustrates the very object for which they are carved out from portions of public streets the main reason for laying out pavements is to 5ure that the pedestrians are able to go out their daily affairs with f reasonable measure of safety and security that facility which has matured into right of the pedestrians cannot be set at naught by allowing encroachments to be made on the pavements there is no substance in the argument adv mced on behalf of the petitioners that the claim of the pavement dwellers to put up constructions on pavements and that of the pedestrians to make use of the pavements for passing repassing are competing claims and that the former should be preferred to the latter no one has the right to make use of public property for private purpose without the requisite authorisation and therefore it is erroneous to contend that the pavement dwellers have the 1 1 1056 supreme court reports 1989 3 c a c right to encroach upon pavements by constructing dwel lings thereon public streets of which pavements form part are primarily dedicated for the purpose of passage and even the pedestrians have but the limited right of using pavements for the purpose of passing and repassing so long as person does not transgress the limited pur pose for which the pavements are made his use thereof is legitimate and lawful but if person puts any public pro perty to use for which it is not intended and is not authorised to use it he becomes trespasser the common example which is cited in some of the english cases see for example hicknan maisey is that if person while using highway for passage sits down for time to rest himself by the side of the road he does not commit trespass but if person puts up dwelling on the pave men whatever may be the economic compulsions behind such an act his user of the pavement would become unauthorised it is also worth noting that assurances had been given on behalf of the state government in its pleading before this court which was repeatedly mentioned in the judgment 21 on behalf of some of the petitioners it was contended that in view of the inclusion of the word socialist in the preamble of the constitution by the 42nd amendment greater concern must be shown to improve the condition of the poor population in the country and every effort should be made to allow them as much benefit as may be possible there cannot be any quarrel with this proposition but that by itself cannot remedy all the problems arising from poverty even the constitution as it stood originally was committed to economic justice and welfare of the needy but for that reason either then or now the other provisions of the constitution and the laws cannot be ignored it is therefore not possible to interpret the decision in olga tellis in the manner to interpret the decision in olga tellis in the manner suggested on behalf of the petitioners to bolster their case with the aid of article 21 g r 22 during his argument mr tarkunde fairly stated that the municipal committee may be entitled to regulate the squatting business of the petitioners but they must make detailed schemes in this regard serious concern was shown in the argument of the other learned advocates also alleging that corruption at large scale was sodan singh n m sharma 1057 rampant and huge amounts of money were being realised illegally by some of the servants of the municipalities from the poor hawkers no rules have been framed with respect to the choice of the persons the area to be allowed to them or the rate of tehbazari charges the permission to squat was being granted on daily basis or for very short periods to the great inconvenience to the hawkers and no machinery was available to hear their grievances draft scheme has been pre pared and filed on behalf of the petitioners with suggestion that the respondents may be directed to adopt it on behalf of the respondents it was said that statutory provisions are already there in this regard 1 but they had to concede that they are too sketchy and incapable of meeting the need we are in the circumstances of the view that b detailed necessary provisions dealing with all relevant aspects and capable of solving the problems aris ing in the situation in fair and equitable manner should be made and the respondents should pro ceed as soon as may be possible they will be well advised to consider the suggestions of the petitioners while finalising the schemes due regard to the requirements of the relevant laws g delhi police act 197ey and the delhi control of vehicular and other traffic on roads and streets regulation 1980 will have to be given 4 4 23 we would however make it clear that the demand of the petitioners that the hawkers must be permitted on every road in the city cannot be allowep if road is not wide enough to conveniently inanage the traffic on it no hawking may be permitted at all or may be sanctioned only once week say on sundays when the rush consider ably thins out hawking may also be justifiably prohibited near hospi tals or where necessity of security measures so demands there may still be other circumstances justifying refusal to permit any kind of business on particular road the demand on behalf of the petitioners that permission to squat on particular place must be on permanent basis also has to be rejected as circumstances are likely to change from time to time but this does not mean that the licence has to be granted on the daily basis that arrangement cannot be convenient to anybody except in special circumstances 24 the authorities while adopting scheme should also con sider the question as to which portions of the pavements should be left free for pedes rians and the number of the squatters to be allowed on particular road there should be rational basis for the choice of the licensees policy decision should be taken in regard to the articles which should be permitted to be sold on the pavements it is common knowledge as was taken note of in bombay hawkers case that some f h 1058 supreme court reports 1989 3 c a of the hawkers in big cities are selling very costly luxury articles includ ing sophisticated electronic goods sometimes imported or smugglea the authorities will be fully justified to deny to such hawkers any facility they may frame rules in such manner that it may benefit only the poor hawkers incapable of investing substantial amount for starting the business attempt should be made to make the scheme comprehensive dealing with every relevant aspect for example the charges to be levied the procedure for grant and revocation of the licences et cetera 25 we as court in welfare state do realise the hardship to which many of the petitioners may be exposed if they are prevented from carrying on the business je only solution for this is the adop tion of the policy of full employni ent which even according to leading economists like keynes will alleviate the problems of the unemployed to some extent but as students of economics we also realise that every human activity has the optimum point beyond which it becomes wholly unproductive it is for the government to take reasonable steps to prevent movement of people from rural areas to urban areas that can be done by the development of urban centres in rural areas removed from each other at least by one hundred miles this is more matter of executive policy than for judicial fiat we hope and trust that in administering the laws in force the authorities will keep in view humane considerations with these observations we dispose of these petitions and remit them to the appropriate division bench for final disposal in accordance with this judgment kuldip singh i have read the erudite judgment of m sharma wherein it has been held that street trading whether as an itinerant vendor hawker or from stationary position receptacle kiosk foot path is fundamental right guaranteed under article 19 1 of the constitution of india the said right is obviously subject to reasonable restrictions imposed by the state under article 19 6 of the constitution it has further been held that there is no fundamental right of citizen to occupy particular place in any street for the purpose of engaging himself in street trading respectfully agree with these findings arrived at by sharma i may however add few words to support these findings g the guarantee under article 19 g extends to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation trade or business profes sion means an occupation carried on by person by virtue of his personal and specialised qualifications training or skill the word sodan singh n m kuldip singh l 1059 occupation has wide meaning such as any regular work prof9ssion job principal activity employment business or calling in which an individual is engaged trade in its wider sense includes any bargain or sale any occupation or business carried on for subsistence or profit it is an act of buying and selling of goods and services it may inc lide any business carried on with view to profit whether manual or mercantile business is very wide term and would include anything which occupies the time attention and labour of man for the purpose of profit it may include in its form trade profession industrial and commercial operations purchase and sale of goods and would include anything which is an occupation as distinguished from pleasure the object of using four analogous and overlapping words in article 19 g is to make the guaranteed right as comprehensive as possible to include all the avenues and modes through which man may earn his livelihood in nut shell the guarantee takes into fold any activity carried on by citizen of india to earn his living the activity must of course be legitimate and not anti social like gambling trafficking in women and the like i street trading is an age old vocation adopted by human beings to earn living in the olden days the venue of trading and business has 1 always been the public streets but in the course of time fairs markets bazars and more recently big shopping complexes and fashionable plazas have come up in spite of this evolution in business and trade patterns the street trading is accepted as one of the legitimate modes of earning livelihood even in the most affluent countries of

under the street trading code may be made by any person aged seventeen or over in writing to the district council the council is under duty to grant the application unless it considers that it ought to be refused on one or more of the following grounds 1 that there is not enough space for the applicant to trade without causing undue interference or inconvenience to street users 2y that there are already enough traders trading in the street from shops or otherwise in the particular goods 3 that the applicant desires to trade on fewer than the minimum number of days resolved on by the council 4 that by reason of some conviction or otherwise he is unsuitable 5 that he has been licensed by the council but has persis tently refused or neglected to pay its fees or charges 6 that he has been granted street trading consent by the council but has refused or neglected to pay its fees 7 that he has without reasonable excuse failed to avail himself to reasonable extent of previous licence the licence specifies the street in which days on which and times between which and describes the articles in which the licence holder is permitted to trade and may contain such subsidiary terms as the council thinks reason able unless previously revoked or surrendered it remains valid for twelve months or such period as is specified in it although if the council resolves that the street be designa ted prohibited street the licence ceases to be valid when the resolution takes affect the council may at any time revoke licence on grounds similar to heads 1 4 5 and 7 above an the licence holder may at any time surrender his licence to the council on receiving an application for the grant or renewal of sodan singh n m ikuldip singh 1061 licence the council must within reasonable time either grant the licence as applied for or serve on the applicant notice specifying with its grounds its proposal to refuse the application to grant licence on different principal terms to grant licence limited to particular place in street to vary the principal terms or to revoke licence and stating that within seven days of receiving the notice the applicant may by written notice require the council to give him the opportunity of making representations in this case the council may not determine the matter until either the applicant has made representations or the time for doing so has elapsed or the applicant has failed to make the representations which he required the council to allow him to make person aggrieved by certain refusals or decisions of council may appeal to magistrates court and appeal from the magistrates decision lies to the crown court the council must give effect to the court decision b d if licence holder applies for the renewal of licence before it expires the old licence remains valid until new licence is granted or during the time for appealing or whilst an appeal is pending and where council decides to vary the principal terms of licence or to revoke it the variation or revocation does not take effect during the time for appe aling or whilst an appeal is pending licence holder may employ assistance without any further licence being required paras 43 lio 448 relate to street trading in greater london and in tli city of london london country council general powers act 1947 and city of london various powers act 1965 provide for designation of streets by the london borough council in respect of which applications for grant of street trading licences are entertained there are provisions for the registration of stne traders the proce re for grant of annual licences and the grounds on which such literices may be refused has been laid down there is complete code in the shape of various statutes which regulates the business of street trading in england trading in the streets of london from stationary position is common sight even in the famous oxford street which is always over crowded there are kiosks receptacles and f h 1062 supreme court reports 1989 3 c b stalls at every street junction from where fruits confectionary soft drinks souvenirs newspapers and various other articles are s9ld street trading is thus one of the traditionally recognised business or trade in england this is so in spite of the fact that there is complete social security in that country and as suc no compulsion on the citizens to be driven to street trading out of poverty or unemployment on the other hand abysmal poverty in india warrants outright rejec tion of the argument that nobody has right to engage himself in street trading justice social economic and political and citizens men and women equally have the right to an adequate means to livelihood which the constitution of india promises is still distinct dream this court in various judgments has reminded the govern ment of its constitutional obligations to ameliorate the lot of the poor in india nothing much ha been achieved an alarming percentage of population in india is still living below poverty line there are millions of registered unemployed the government in spite of constitutional mandate is unable to provide them with employment but when by gathering meagre resources they try to employ themselves as hawkers or street traders they cannot be stopped on the pretext that they have no right rather the government should render all help to rehabilitate them mr tarkunde contended that street trading being common law right has to be treated as fundamental right under article 19 1 of the constitution of india it is not necessary to examine the matter from this aspect once street trading is accepted as legitimate trade business or occupation it automatically comes within the protec tion guaranteed under article 19 g of the constitution of india there is no dispute that public streets are primarily to be used by the public generally as pathways for passing and repassing but there are other ancillary purposes for which the public streets can be sed as of right in manzur hasan muhammed zaman 52 a 61 the vy council held as under in india there is right to conduct religious proce sion with its appropriate observances through public street so that it does not interfere with the ordinary use of the street by the public and subject to lawful directions by the magis tr ates civil suit for declaration lies against those who interfere with religious procession or its appropriate observance h in saghir ahmed the state of p and others 1955 1 c sodan singh n m kuldip singh 1063 707 this court held that business of transporting passengers with the aid of vehicles was trade or business and as such was guaranteed under article 19 1 of the constitution of india in himat lal shah commissioner of police ahmedabad and another 1973 2 c 266 this court held that right to hold public meeting on public street is fundaillental right under article 19 1 and of the constitution of india and the same cannot be arbitrarily denied there is thus no justification to deny the citizens of their right to earn livelihood by using the public streets for the purpose of trade and business j in india there are large number of people who are engaged in the business of street trading there is hardly household where hawkers do not reach the house wives wait for vegetable vendor or fruit seller who conveniently delivers the daily needs at the door step the petitioners before us are street traders of delhi and new delhi areas some of them have licences fehbazari from municipal corporation of delhi new delhi municipal committee but most of them are squat ters there is practically no law regulating street trading in delhi new delhi the skeletal provisions in the delhi municipalcorporation act 1957 and the punjab municipal act 1911 can hardly provide any regulatory measures to the enormous and complicated roblem of b r street trading in these areas in bombay hawkers union and others bombay municipal corporation and others 1985 3 c 525 this court suggested that schemes be framed to regulate the hawking business by creating hawk ing and non hawking zones again in municipal corporation of delhi gurnam kaur lr 1989 c 38 this court observed as under f we feel that the municipal corporation authori ties in consultation with the delhi development authority should endeavour to find solution on the lines as sug gested in bombay hawkers union e by creating hawk ing and non hawking zones and shifting the pavement squatters to areas other than non hawking zones the authorities in devising scheme must endeavour to achieve a twin object viz to preserve and maintain the beauty and the grandeur of this great historic city of delhi from an aesthetic point of view by reducing congestion on the public streets and removing all encroachments which cause obstructions to the free flow of traffic and rehabilitate those unfortunate persons who by force or circ1 mstances 1064 supreme court reports 1989 3 c a are made to ply their trade or business on pavements or public streets street trading being fundamental right has to be made avail able to the citizens subject to article 19 6 of the constitution it is within the domain of the state to make any law imposing reasonable restrictions in the interest of general public this can be done by an enactment on the same lines as in england or by any other law permis sible under article 19 6 of the constitution in spite of repeated suggestions by this court nothing has been done in this respect since citizen has no right to choose particular place in any street for trad ing it is for the state to designate the streets and earmark the places from where street trading can be done in action on the part of the state would result in negating the fundamental right of the citizens it is expected that the state will do the needful in this respect within reasonable time failing which it would be left to the courts to protect the rights of the citizens d s petitions disposed of ill i '], ['nafr

again soon alier his release from jail is not misconceived he crime allegedly nrmitted by the detenu created panic and embarrassment in the localit t he criminal activities of the detenu not only

and public order the offences con rmitted against particular individual fall within the ambit of law and order and when the public at large is adversely affected by the crirninal activities of person such activities of that person are said to disturb the public order moreover individual cases can be dealt with by the criminal justice system therefore there is no need for the detaining authority to invoke the draconian preventive detention laws against an individual hence according to the hon ble apex court the detaining autholity should be wary of invoking the immense power under the act 8 in

cannot be characterized as habitual act because the idea of habit involves an element of persistence and tendency to commit or repeat similar offences which is patently not present in the instant case in the crime relied upon by the detaining authority the two bail petitions moved by the alleged detenu were dismissed by the court concerned thus as on the date of passing ol the impugned detention

the alleged detenue is an hnrnoral traffic offender she has been indulging in human trafficking for the sake of prostitution and running organized prostitution business with trafficked girls for her

conditional bail in crime no 8l 8 of 2021 thetwo bail applications filed by the detenu in crirne no 6l4 of 2022 were dismissed thus the apprehension of the detaining authority that there is imminent possibility of detenue indulging in similar prejudicial activities again soon after her release from jail is not misconceived the crime allegedly committed by the detenue created panic and embarrassment in the locality the criminal activities of the detenue not only endanger the family system but also create social unrest causing widespread health hazards to the general public therefore the detaining authority is legally justified in passing the impugned detention order further the advisory board rendered its opinion that there is sufficient cause for detention of the detenue and on

by the criminal justice system therefore there is no need for the detaining authority to invoke the draconian preventive detention laws against an individual hence according to the hon ble i 7 frqj st js w t 0 q 3 3 0f 20 2 2 apex couft the detaining authority should be wary of invoking the immense power under the act 8 in ram manohar lohia state of biharr the hon ble supreme courl has in fact deprecated the invoking of the preventive law in order to tackle law and order problem it was observed that every breach of public peace and every violation of law may create law and order problem but does not necessarily create problem of public order the distinction has to be borne in rnind in view of what has been stated in the grourrds of detention in kanu biswas state of west bengal2 the hon ble apex court while discussing the meaning of word public order held that the question whether man has only committed breach of law and order or has acted in manner likely to cause disturbance of the public order is question of degree and extent of the reach of the act upon the society 10 in the present case the detaining authority basing on the crimes indicated above has passed the impugned

passed by placing reliance on the aforesaid crimes which relates to immoral trafficking here it is appropriate to refer to the decision rendered by the hon ble supreme court in vijay narain singh state of bihar3 wherein it was held that single act or 3 lres 3 scc 14 9 aar s js 14 no 34233 of 2022 omission cannot be characterized as habitual act because the idea of habit involves an element of persistence and tendency to commit or repeat similar offences which is patently not present in the instant case insofar as crime no 818 of 2021 is concerned the detenue was granted conditional bail by the court concerned tn vide order dated 03 12 2021 and was released on bail insofar as crime no 6l4 of 2022 is concerned the two bail applications moved by the detenue were dismissed and the third bail application is pending befbre the learned xi additional district judge b nagar fufther the detenue was granted bail in solitary crime no b18 of 2021 and in three bail petitions moved by the alleged detenue two of them were dismissed and the third bail petition is pending before the court concerned thus as on the date of passing of the impugned detention order the alleged detenue continues to be in judicial custody under these circumstances the apprehension of the detaining authority that there is imminent possibility of the detenue indulging in similar prejudicial activities again soon after her release from jail which would be prejudicial to the maintenance of public order unless she is prevented from doing so by an appropriate order of detention is highly misplaced since the detenue has allegedly committed the offences punis tg under the indian penal code and pita the said crimes can be effectively dealt with under the provisions i i l0 4r ljs e no 34233 of 2022 of indian penal code and the said special law the crirnes relied upon by the detaining authority does not add up to disturbing the public order and it is confined within the ambit and scope of the words law and order hence there is no need for the detaining authority to pass the impugned detention order the detaining authority cannot be permitted to subveft supplant or substitute the punitive law of land by ready resorl to preventive detention 12 for the foregoing reasons the impugned orders are legally ur rsustainable and are liable to be set aside 13 in the result the writ petition is

370 1 376 34 of ipc and sections 4 6 of pocso act 2 the case of the prosecution in brief is that on 17 11 2021 at around 3 00 pm the victim informed her mother the complainant that she is going to typing class the victim did not return for some time which made the complainant suspicious and hence complainant went to the typing class of the victim and enquired only to find out that the victim never made it to the typing class hence the complainant is suspicion rose more and she went to the house of one jyoti gupta who was her relative to enquire about the victim where she found out that said jyoti gupta was also not present at her house hence the complainant came to conclusion that the said jyoti gupta had kidnapped the victim and forcefully taken the victim with her 3 counsel for the applicant submits that there are seven co accused in the crime the present applicant who happens to be resident of nagpur maharashtra and he runs auto in the city it so happened that the victim and the co accused namely jyoti gupta reached nagpur and they were standing in the bus stand at an odd hour the applicant offered help and took the co accused jyoti gupta with victim to his house where they resides with his family it is also the allegation that on the next day the applicant introduced the co accused jyoti gupta and the victim to their neighbours namely rukhsar and akash and apart from this there is no involvement as alleged in the aforesaid crime he further submits that according to the prosecution case the prosecutrix was thereafter taken to kishangarh and when she was

and he is in jail since 27 01 2022 and trial is likely to take some time therefore the application may be allowed 4 on the other hand state counsel submits that victim who happens to be minor was

the present applicant is that he offered help to co accused jyoti gupta and victim when they reached to nagpur and took them to his house and introduced them to their neighbour rukhsar and akash and thereafter the victim was subjected to human trafficking she fairly submits that there is no allegation with regard to physical harm being committed by the present applicant to the victim since he is

applicant is that he took the prosecutrix and co accused jyoti gupta to his house and thereafter introduced to his neighbour rukhsar and akash it does not appear that the prosecutrix was subjected to any harm or physical abuse by this applicant it is also not evident that the applicant was involved in human trafficking prima facie looking to the detention period of the applicant and trial is

19 43 hours and taken in custody he was innocent the sole earning member of the family and otherwise had not committed any offence it was therefore fit case to order his release on bail on such terms

claimed that he was law abiding citizen innocent and the sole earning member of his family he had not committed any offence and therefore it was fit case for grant 4 crmab 276 and 275 of 2019 of bail on such terms and conditions as may be imposed by this hon ble court 3 the state opposed the applications on the premise that the complainant had lodged complaint at the police station prior to july 2019 and till date the two applicants with two others acting in furtherance of their common intention and for their monetary benefits procured lured and induced the minor victim girl into commercial sexual activities and provided her to various customers for money which were arranged by them in closed premises within the vicinity of public places furthermore the applicants have also threatened the victim girl with dire consequences in case she refuses to go to the customers arranged by them giving rise to the registration of the offence under the earlier stated provisions of law the applicants were placed under arrest on the evening of 17 10 2019 and the necessary investigation had been commenced in the case the statement of the victim girl was recorded in the presence of ngo and which was found corroborating with the complaint moreover her statement was also recorded under section 164 crpc by the jmfc vasco 5 crmab 276 and 275 of 2019 4 the victim was medically examined which confirmed that there was an evidence of vaginal penetration the victim was also minor as revealed from her medical examination the two applicants had criminal record and particularly the applicant no 1 who was notorious character while the second applicant was budding criminal their presence in the custody was essential to investigate their role in the entire crime and besides there were several cases registered at the vasco police station there were several girls in the said activity on account of the involvement of the applicants and whose identity was required to be confirmed the applicants had not been cooperating with the course of investigation and besides there was every possibility that they may flee from the state and would not be available for the investigation if released on bail which may hamper the investigation in view thereof their applications had to be dismissed 5 heard shri agha learned advocate for the applicants who reiterated the contents of his application read through the complaint and submitted at the outset that an offence under section 376 ipc was not attracted to the case the bail 6 crmab 276 and 275 of 2019 applications filed by the applicants were rejected by the learned sessions judge he placed reliance in freedom firm s commissioner of police pune and ors cr public interest litigation no 4 of 2015 and submitted that there was no basis in the case of the respondents that the applicants would jump the bail plea that there were other offences registered against the applicants would also not survive in view of the disposal of the said proceedings in the circumstances therefore and as the investigation in the case was almost complete the applicants had to be enlarged on bail 6 shri mahesh amonkar learned additional public prosecutor for the state submitted at the outset that the applicants were placed under arrest on 17 10 2019 and thereafter the statements of the victim and other girls were recorded the victim girl is under constant fear and threats from the applicants and therefore it is not fit case to order the bail of the applicants until the statement of the victim is recorded in the court the offence alleged is serious in nature and therefore they are not entitled to the benefit of bail he however fairly 7 crmab 276 and 275 of 2019 conceded that the time limit for filing the charge sheet was likely to expire on 17th instant 7 have heard shri agha learned advocate for the applicants and shri mahesh amonkar learned additional public prosecutor for the respondents and besides perused the records of investigation including the case diary it is apparent from consideration of the complaint that detailed report was made by brother sebastian george headmaster of the school indicating in detail how the victim girl name withheld was submitted to the sexual activities and that it was also reflecting on her performance in the school including nonattendance it was also indicted from the complaint that the victim was minor and that her initiation in sexual activities was at the instance of the two females and the applicants and that it could never be assumed that the offence under section 376 ipc was not made out against her as was the contention of shri agha learned advocate for the applicants rather cursory perusal of the complaint would indicate that the victim girl was subjected to the sexual activities much against her consent considering her tender age and that she was also subjected to fear and threats 8 crmab 276 and 275 of 2019 apart from intimidation in case she did not cooperate with them in participating in the illicit activities at their instance therefore the contention on behalf of the applicants that they were entitled to the benefit of bail cannot be entertained 8 in freedom firm supra which also involved case of trafficking under the immoral trafficking prevention act 1956 itpa w section 370 ipc the accused had applied for an anticipatory bail which was readily granted in his favour it was carved out on behalf of the petitioners that there was misuse of the provisions of bail which results in stalling the proceedings under the itpa and thereby deprives the victims of their rightful claim to rehabilitation apart from indirectly encouraging illegal trafficking in the said case several guidelines were laid down in the matter of grant of bail in the cases of human trafficking which were recorded in paragraph 26 of the order 9 furthermore in freedom firm supra guidelines were also laid down in paragraph 30 for streamlining the prosecution of the cases of human trafficking and the matter of grant of bail in such cases too were spelt out considering the guidelines laid down therein it cannot at all be heard on behalf of the 9 crmab 276 and 275 of 2019 applicants that they would be entitled to the benefit of bail in the factual matrix there are several offences registered against the applicants and although two cases have been closed as summary and in one case he has been acquitted the fact however remains that he is still involved in the serious offences of the vasco police station under section 307 amongst others looking to the tender age of the victim and the manner in which she has been lured in this case there is no basis for ordering the release of the applicants on bail even by imposing stringent conditions the fact that the first applicant is on the threshold of getting married and settling into matrimony is not ground for ordering his release on bail when juxta positioned with the nature of the offences alleged against him and the gravity and seriousness of the crime 10 find favour with the contention of shri amonkar learned additional public prosecutor that ordering the release of the applicants at this stage would be counterproductive to the case of the prosecution and there is every possibility that the victim might not be available for examination in the court when the chargesheet is filed against the applicants shortly giving 10 crmab 276 and 275 of 2019 weightage to the fact that she is under fear and there are threats and intimidation to her and to her safety at the instance of the applicants in case she does not cooperate in their activities of trafficking and sexual exploitation do not find any merit in the applications which are hereby dismissed mv nutan

paragraphs 1 to 5 has held as under the instant writ petition filed by the petitioners 1 under article 32 of the constitution of india raises important issues touching upon the efficacy of the criminal justice system in this country in an adversarial system which is prevalent by india the court is supposed to decide the cases on the basis of evidence produced before it this evidence can be in the form of documents it can be oral evidence as well e the deposition of witnesses the witnesses thus play vital role in facilitating the court to arrive at correct findings on disputed questions of facts and to find out where the truth lies they are therefore backbone in decision making process whenever in dispute the two sides come out with conflicting version the witnesses become important tool to arrive at right conclusions thereby advancing justice in matter this principle applies with more vigor and strength in criminal cases inasmuch as most of such cases are decided on the basis of testimonies of the witnesses particularly eye witnesses who may have seen actual occurrence crime it is for this reason that bentham stated more than 150 years ago that witnesses are eyes and ears of justice 2 thus witnesses are important players in the judicial system who help the judges in arriving at correct factual findings the instrument of evidence is the medium through which facts either disputed or required to be proved are effectively conveyed to the courts this evidence in the form of documentary and writ petition no 26319 2019 8 oral is given by the witnesses witness may be partisan or interested witness e witness who is in near relation with the victim of crime or is concerned with conviction of the accused person even his testimony is relevant though stricter scrutiny is required while adjudging the credence of such victim however apart from these witnesses or the witnesses who may themselves be the victims other witnesses may not have any personal interest in the outcome of case they still help the judicial system in the words of whittaker chambers witness is man whose life and faith are so completely one that when the challenge comes to step out and testify for his faith he does so disregarding all risks accepting all consequences1 3 the importance of the witness particularly in criminal trial is highlighted in book in the following manner in search of truth he plays that sacred role of the sun which eliminates the darkness of ignorance and illuminates the face of justice encircled by devils of humanity and compassion xxx xxx xxx the value of witnesses can be denied keeping in view the dependency of the criminal proceedings on the testimonies and cooperation of witnesses in all the stages of the proceedings especially in those cases where the prosecution has to establish the guilt with absolute certainty via oral cross examination of witnesses in hearings open to the world at large in such cases the testimony of witness even if not as an eye witness may prove to be crucial in determining the circumstances in which the crime might have been committed 4 notwithstanding the same the conditions of witnesses in indian legal system can be termed as pathetic there are many threats faced by the witnesses at various stages of an investigation and then during the trial of case apart from facing life threatening intimidation to himself and to his relatives he may have to face the trauma of attending the court regularly because of the lack of witness protection programme in india and the treatment that is meted out to them there is tendency of reluctance in coming forward and making statement during the investigation and or testify in courts these witnesses neither have any legal remedy nor do they get suitably treated the present legal system takes witnesses completely for granted they are summoned to court regardless of their financial and personal conditions many times they are writ petition no 26319 2019 9 made to appear long after the incident of the alleged crime which significantly hampers their ability to recall necessary details at the time of actual crime they are not even suitably remunerated for the loss of time and the expenditure towards conveyance etc 5 in swaran singh vs state of punjab3 this court speaking through wadhwa expressed view on conditions of witnesses by stating that the witnesses are harassed lot they come from distant places and see the case is adjourned they have to attend the court many times on their own it has become routine that case is adjourned till the witness is tired and will stop coming to court in this process lawyers also play an important role sometimes witness is threatened maimed or even bribed there is no protection to the witnesses by adjourning the case the court also becomes party to such miscarriage of justice the witness is not given respect by the court they are pulled out of the court room by the peon after waiting for the whole day he sees the matter being adjourned there is no proper place for him to sit and drink glass of water when he appears he is subjected to prolong stretched examinations and cross examinations for these reasons persons avoid becoming witness and because of this administration of justice are hampered the witnesses are not paid money within time the high courts must be vigilant in these matters and should avoid harassment in these matters by subordinate staff the witnesses should be paid immediately irrespective of the fact whether he examines or the matter is adjourned the time has come now that all courts should be linked with each other through computer the bar council of india has to play important role in this process to put the criminal justice system on track though the trial judge is aware that witness is telling lie still he is not ready to file complaint against such witness because he is required to sign the same there is need to amend section 340 3 of cr c 14 in the aforesaid case the hon ble supreme court approved the witness protection scheme 2018 the aim and object of the scheme is to ensure that investigation prosecution and trial of criminal case is not prejudiced because

show that an amount of rs 49 500 was received by the present applicant from co accused shikharchand who purchased the victim girl from co accused naushe khan 10 the victim it appears was subjected to continuous sexual assault and therefore when she was traced she was found to be pregnant minor girl was forced to carry pregnancy and the present 4 110919ba829 19 odt applicant is having definite role in the crime inasmuch as she actively participated not only participated but also obtained remuneration for selling the victim girl from one co accused to another co accused 11 while dealing with the applications for bail this court has noticed that recently there is spurt in such type of offences in this part of the country the girls like the victim in present crime who is resident of jafar nagar nagpur having no concern with the state of madhya pradesh or rajasthan are taken away to such place and are forced to marry with the person from madhya pradesh or rajasthan it appears that luckily the girl was traced out in such circumstances am of the opinion that this type of offence has to be dealt with by the courts at every stage with iron hand so that the unscrupulous persons like the present applicant may be woman for fulfilling the lust of some money will not dare to sell human whether male or female in future 12 in view of the aforesaid the application deserves to be rejected and the

from economically weak background and thereafter selling them for valuable consideration accordingly the petitioner does not stand on the same footing with the co accused namely juhi chowdhury against whom the allegation was of providing political patronage to such alleged crime we have considered the rival submissions of the parties we find that the petitioner is medical practitioner and member of the concerned child welfare committee there are materials on record to show that he had made arrangements for delivery of babies from unwed mothers and or women from economically deprived background and thereafter dishonestly removed such children from their natural parents by claiming that they had died in child birth subsequently the said children were sold to others for illegal adoption role of the petitioner in the alleged crime is central and cannot be equated with the co accused namely juhi chowdhury who is alleged to have played marginal role in the said conspiracy by providing political patronage hence keeping in mind the gravity of the offence and the principal role played by the petitioner in indulging in illegal human trafficking of babies we are of the opinion that in view of the gravity of the offence this is not fit case to grant bail to the petitioner at this stage the application for bail is thus rejected however balance ought to be struck between the gravity of the offence and undertrial detention which is of considerable period we are informed that there is slow and tardy progress before the trial court in an important case as the present one which has far reaching 3 ramifications in society we are also informed that recording of prosecution evidence is in progress under such circumstances we direct the trial court to hold the trial on day to day

the reliable sources the investigating officer alongwith panchas conducted raid at oyo home sunset view donapaula at about 22 30 hours of 10 5 2019 to 1 30 hours of 11 5 2019 the applicant and other accused namely mr sajid shaikh bunty mr sarfaraz khan mr dipendra singh bhandari mr ismail mohammad sab hanabarkadabi and rehan full name address not known were found involved in prostitution trade by procuring victim girls who were exploited against their will for the purpose of prostitution by forcing them to have sexual intercourse with prospective customers it appears that mobile handset of the

submitted by the learned additional public prosecutor that the wireless message received from the police station hindol orissa 5 crmab175 2019 indicates that there were no adverse reports against the applicant at the said police station however it appears that the applicant is involved in the trade of prostitution with the help of other accused for illegal financial gains by indulging in human trafficking offences in deed are very serious in nature and would affect the society at large 9 merely because the permanent residential address of the applicant in the state of orissa has been confirmed that would not in itself be sufficient to release him on bail especially when investigation is in progress and one of the accused is untraceable no doubt only because the applicant is non goan would not be reason to refuse the bail as observed by this court in case of arun babu sigata supra nevertheless nature of the offence and the manner in which it was conducted cannot be ignored while considering the application for bail 10 it would be essential for the investigating officer to trace the entire network of the traffickers by interrogating the applicant as well as other members of the gang and therefore it would not be safe to release the 6 crmab175 2019 applicant at this stage it appears that offence involves trafficking of more than one persons which provides for rigorous life imprisonment with fine 11 there is reasonable apprehension in the mind of the investigating agency and rightly so that in case of release of the applicant there is likelihood of threatening the witnesses as it is an oragnised racked which is an evil against the society 12 in case of amar singh supra it is stated in paragraph 11 thus 11 seriousness of the allegations or the availability of the material in support thereof is not only the considerations for declining the bail after all at the pre conviction stage there is presumption of innocence that apart the object of keeping person in

availability of material in support thereof are not the only considerations for declining bail delay in commencement and conclusion of trial is factor to be taken into account and the accused cannot

preferred by the applicant for seeking bail from commission of an offence in which she has been named as an accused and has been registered as case crime no 354 of 2017 under sections 366 370 3 4 5 342 120 of ipc registered at s kotwali ranipur district haridwar 2 as per the set of allegations and on perusal of records it was found that an fir was registered at the aforesaid police station on 03 09 2017 by the h anti human trafficking unit of district haridwar as per the fir itself the applicant to the bail application has been named at no 4 the allegation which is apparently reflected to be levied against the applicant accused is that when on 03 09 2017 raid was conducted the police team and the h anti human trafficking on the basis of the information which has been received from the mukhbir they raided the premises in question then while committing the raid he found that in the accommodation in question which the applicant says that it was rented accommodation which was taken on rent by one mr ramdas and on raid it was found that in the room there were three ladies and two children and one child who was sitting on the bed was crying it has also been recorded in the fir that when questions were posed to the ladies that these children belong to whom none of the ladies have 2 extended any answer but rather they started looking to one another without giving the answer meaning thereby it could be presumed at this stage that even the children who were there in the room did not belong to any of the three ladies who were found in the room accordingly the police team after conducting the aforesaid raid and on considering the circumstances which existed came to the conclusion that the other ladies namely asha and seeta who are the named accused persons and who were sitting in the adjoining room were the ladies who were involved in with other co accused persons in the business of human trafficking 3 even so much so that the ladies who were found in the room had made statement that they have been brought in there with an assurance extended by accused persons for the purposes of providing them with job but there was no job ever provided to them and rather the accused persons were using them for illegal human trafficking and also forcing them to indulge in the act of prostitution 4 under the aforesaid backdrop the applicant had earlier filed bail application before this court being bail application no 1910 of 2017 and this court after hearing the counsel for the applicant at length had rejected the bail application after considering the gravity of the offence in which the accused applicant was said to have engaged herself 5 the argument which has been extended by the learned counsel for the applicant in order to press his second bail application is from the view point that there is non compliance of sub section 4 of section 100 of the code of criminal procedure in order to appreciate the arguments for the said purpose sub section 4 of section 100 is quoted hereunder 100 persons in charge of closed place to allow search 4 before making search under this chapter the officer or other person about to make it shall call upon two or 3 more independent and respectable inhabitants of the locality in which the place to be searched is situate or of any other locality if no such inhabitant of the said locality is available or is willing to be witness to the search to attend and witness the search and may issue an order in writing to them or any of them so to do 6 rather if we go through the implications and purpose as it shows that its procedural in nature the purpose of it is simply lays down the modalities and the manner in which search has to be conducted by the police parties when it is to be done in the closed premises where the ladies and the children were kept as it is the situation in the present case what he intends to contend is that at the time when the raid was conducted by the police party there were no independent witnesses nor any other responsible person of the locality who had came forward to support the theory of search which was conducted by the police party as reported in the fir against the applicant for answer to the provisions contained under sub section 4 to section 100 which is procedural it is contended by the government advocate that there is no reason why to disbelieve the manner in which the raid was conducted by the police party and there is no reason also to disbelieve more particularly if see the pleading and arguments as extended by the counsel for the applicant when the fact of the recovery of the three ladies and the children from the accommodation in question is not disputed nor the same has been denied by the present applicant rather to the contrary to shy away from the responsibility of having indulged in commission of the said offence the counsel had submitted that the accommodation from where the ladies and the three children were recovered by the police party in fact was tenanted accommodation which was let out to one mr ramdas who was the brother of the applicant and for the said reason the applicant cannot be made responsible because the ladies were recovered from the tenement which was let out to mr ramdas who has been released on bail by the sessions court by an order dated 01 03 2019 this argument to claim the parity is not very alluring to the court as the accused applicant and ramdas whose accommodation was used for commission of the crime had altogether different role in commission of offence hence no parity can be granted to the applicant 4 7 second argument which has been extended by the learned counsel for the applicant was that no medical examination was conducted on the ladies who were recovered by the police from the premises in question and hence the story as developed by the police in the fir cannot be believed with because the set of allegations was with regards to forcing the ladies to indulge in prostitution and that allegation could have only been established had the medical been conducted on them he further submits that the story of the prosecution is highly improbable because one of the ladies who was recovered by the police party was the lady who was married about 10 to12 years earlier and it cannot be believed with that the lady of the said age could be confined by the applicant in the room in question and would be forced to indulge in the act of prostitution 8 he has submitted that there had been non compliance of section 15 of the immoral traffic prevention act of 1956 which reads as under 15 search without warrant 1 notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force whenever the special police officer 49 or the trafficking police officer as the case may be has reasonable grounds for believing that an offence punishable under this act has been or is being committed in respect of 50 person living in any premises and that search of the premises with warrant cannot be made without undue delay such officer may after recording the grounds of his belief enter and search such premises without warrant 2 before making search under sub section 1 the special police officer 51 or the trafficking police officer as the case may be shall call upon two or more respectable inhabitants at least one of whom shall be woman of the locality in which the place to be searched is situate to attend and witness the search and may issue an order in writing to them or any of them so to do 52 provided that the requirement as to the respectable inhabitants being from the locality in which the place to be searched is situate shall not apply to woman required to attend and witness the search 3 any person who without reasonable cause refuses or neglects to attend and witness search under this section when called upon to do so by an order in writing delivered or tendered to him shall be deemed to have committed an offence under section 187 of the indian penal code 45 of 1860 5 4 the special police officer or the trafficking police officer as the case may be entering any premises under sub section 1 shall be entitled to remove therefrom all the persons found therein 5 the special police officer 51 or the trafficking police officer as the case may be after removing54 the 50 person under sub section 4 shall forthwith produce 55 him before the appropriate magistrate 5a any person who is produced before magistrate under sub section 5 shall be examined by registered medical practitioner for the purposes of determination of the age of such person or for the detection of any injuries as result of sexual abuse or for the presence of any sexually transmitted diseases explanation in sub section registered medical practitioner has the same meaning as in the indian medical council act 1956 102 of 1956 6 the special police officer 51 or the trafficking police officer as the case may be and other persons taking part in or attending and witnessing search shall not be liable to any civil or criminal proceedings against them in respect of anything lawfully done in connection with or for the purpose of the search this 6a the special police officer or the trafficking police officer as the case may be making search under this section shall be accompanied by at least two women police officers and where any woman or girl removed under sub section 4 is required to be interrogated it shall be done by woman police officer and if no woman police officer is available the interrogation shall be done only in the presence of lady member of recognised welfare institution or organisation explanation for the purpose of this sub section and section 17a recognised welfare institution or organisation means such institution or organisation as may be recognised in this behalf by the state government 7 the provisions of the code of criminal procedure 1973 2 of 1974 shall so far as may be apply to any search under this section as they apply to any search made under the authority of warrant issued under section 94 of the said code 9 section 15 of the said act yet again it only lays down the process of search of premises without issuance of warrant rather to the contrary section 15 starts with non obstinate clause wherein it provides that irrespective of the provisions contained under section 15 it will not create any impediment over the powers of the special police officer or the trafficking police office as the case may be merely that only on reasonable belief they can always raid premises and search the premises for which warrant may not be necessary prior to the search more particularly when it involves the confinement of the children and ladies in the premises rather if we scrutinize the intention and the purpose of section 15 of the said act 6 the non compliance of which is complaint of by the applicant in its very specific terms has laid down that the search of premises with warrant cannot be made without an undue delay because an officer would have to wait for issuance of the warrant and after recording the grounds for not getting the warrants issued and on the ground of the belief of an offence itself the special officer and the officer involved in protection of human trafficking had been conferred with the power to enter the premises and search the premises even without the issuance of the warrant 10 lastly the learned counsel for the applicant submits that there was non compliance of the provision contained under section 437 sub section 2 of the code of criminal procedure it was to the effect that wherever the ladies who are said to be involved in the commission of an offence and they are kept under the police custody if they are below the age of 16 years or is woman who is sick or infirm she has to be released on bail section 437 2 of cr c is quoted hereunder 2 if it appears to such officer or court at any stage of the investigation inquiry or trial as the case may be that there are not reasonable grounds for believing that the accused has committed non bailable offence but that there are sufficient grounds for further inquiry into his 1 guilt the accused shall subject to the provisions of section 446a and pending such inquiry be released on bail or at the discretion of such officer or court on the execution by him of bond without sureties for his appearance as hereinafter provided 11 after going through the set of allegations which has been narrated in the first information report as registered against the present applicant at no point of time or at any stage of the proceedings subsequent thereto which has been affirmed by evidence that the applicants who are named in the fir fulfills the conditions of sub section 2 of section 437 so as to entitle them for grant of bail because according to the finding which has been recorded in the fir age of seeta applicant of the present bail application is shown to be lady of about 60 years of age as apparent from the memo of the bail application filed by herself even similarly the other co accused 7 asha who is an applicant to the connected bail application is also lady of about 32 years of age hence under these circumstances the implications as intended by sub section 2 of section 437 will not come into play as both the accused person though being lady they were beyond the age prescribed by sub section 2 of section 437 of the code of criminal procedure 12 on considering the set of allegations in its totality as levelled in the fir pertaining to the commission of an offence under sections 366 370 3 4 5 342 120 of ipc this court is not inclined to grant the second bail as there is no changed circumstances which has taken place after the rejection of the earlier bail application on 14 09 2018 to consider the second bail application 13 consequently the second bail application is rejected sharad kumar sharma 20 06 2019 pooja '], ['in the high court of

3 judgment the petitioners herein are the de facto complainants in crime no 3753 of 2015 of the kayamkulam police station final report was laid in the said case on 15 10 2016 and the accused travel agent is alleged to have committed offences punishable under section 420 of the ipc and section 26 of the emigration act 1983 this petition is filed under article 226 of the constitution of india with prayer to issue writ of mandamus directing the central bureau of investigation to take up further investigation 2 facts germane to the filing of the present petition lie in narrow compass statement was furnished by the 1st petitioner wherein it was asserted that after working for over half decade overseas he had come back to india and is working as tile worker he had occasion to watch an advertisement in the tv placed by the accused who is travel agent based at kayamkulam the accused offered employment overseas in food processing company the 1st petitioner along with his uncle met him and sum of rs 1 lakh was paid visa offering employment as cleaner was procured by the accused with which he went abroad he managed to work overseas for three months in the first month he worked in company by wp no 1748 of 2019 4 name etisalat and was paid sum of rs 12 000 when he found that the job offered was not provided he along with others contacted the indian embassy and their case was referred to the labour court later the petitioners were repatriated back to india 3 the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners submitted that the 1st petitioner was duped into obtaining an employment visa promising placement with prominent company in the uae the same is the case with the rest of the petitioners as well on reaching uae they were forced to work in menial conditions they were taken to labour camp and had to live in poor conditions being deprived of proper salary they had to fend for themselves when the petitioners refused to convert to islam they were ousted from their accommodation it was with much effort that they had petitioned the higher authorities and had managed to return back to india according to the petitioners the recruitment undertaken by the accused is nothing other than human trafficking the activities are undertaken in an organized manner and it has inter state and inter national ramification according to the petitioner though the offence under section 370 of the ipc was also made out the investigating officer has acted hand in glove with the accused and has included lesser offences the learned counsel fervently submitted that unless wp no 1748 of 2019 5 the 5th respondent is ordered to investigate the case the interest of justice would suffer 4 the inspector general of police kochi range has filed factual report controverting the contentions of the petitioner in the said report he has stated that though the investigation was meticulously conducted no evidence was obtained to substantiate the commission of offences under sections 370 and 370a of the ipc the investigation revealed that the accused offered job overseas and he failed to provide the assured job it is also stated that another crime has been registered against the 1st accused at the kayamkulam police station under sections 406 and 420 of the ipc 5 the learned government pleader has also opposed the prayer he would point out that the 1st petitioner is person who had worked abroad for over five years he would point out that exhibit p1 visa is one as cleaner in the uae and hence the contention that an elite job was offered overseas is not correct 6 the retainer counsel appearing for the fifth respondent submitted that the investigation having completed and final report having been laid further investigation by the cbi is not warranted 7 have considered the submissions and have perused the records wp no 1748 of 2019 6 8 the grievance of the petitioners essentially is that section 370 of the ipc though was made out the investigating agency has not incorporated the said penal provision section 370 deals with trafficking of person and section 370a deals with exploitation of trafficked person explanation 1 to section 370 provides an inclusive definition for the term exploitation to include any act of physical exploitation or any form of sexual exploitation slavery or practices similar to slavery servitude or the forced removal or organs in the facts and circumstances find it difficult to accept the contention of the learned counsel that section 370 of the ipc is attracted in the facts and circumstances 9 even otherwise do not think that the petitioner has made out case for ordering further investigation by the cbi in secretary minor irrigation and rural engineering services p and ors sahngoo ram arya and ors air 2002 sc 2225 it was observed by the apex court that decision to direct an inquiry by the cbi against person can only be done if the high court after considering the material on record comes to conclusion that such material does disclose prima facie case calling for an investigation by the cbi or any other similar agency and the same cannot be done as matter of routine or merely because

paragraph no 43 as follows before parting with the case we deem it necessary to emphasise that despite wide powers conferred by articles 32 and 226 of the constitution while passing any order the courts must bear in mind certain self imposed limitations on the exercise of these constitutional powers the very plenitude of the power under the said articles requires great caution in its exercise in so far as the question of issuing direction to the cbi to conduct investigation in case is concerned although no inflexible guidelines can be laid down to decide whether or not such power should be exercised but time and again it has been reiterated that such an order is not to be passed as matter of routine or merely because party has levelled some allegations against the local police this extra ordinary power must be exercised sparingly cautiously and in exceptional situations where it becomes necessary to provide credibility and instill confidence in investigations or where the incident may have national and international ramifications or where such an order may be necessary for doing complete justice and enforcing the fundamental rights this does not appear to be one such case 11 applying the principles laid down by the apex court in the instant case am of the considered view that the petitioners have not wp no 1748 of 2019 8 made out case for ordering further investigation by the cbi as held by the apex court the extra ordinary power of entrusting the investigation with the cbi will have to be exercised sparingly cautiously and in exceptional situations

may fly abroad and may not co operate with the investigating agency and he may also not available for trial on these grounds he prayed to dismiss the petition 8 have carefully and cautiously gone through the submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties and perused the records 9 before considering the submissions made by the learned counsel appearing for the parties want to place it on record as to what are the parameters which the court has to keep in mind while considering the bail application which have been elaborately discussed by the hon ble apex court in paragraph 112 of its decision in the case of siddharam satlingappa mhetre vs state of maharashtra and others reported in 2011 1 scc 694 which read as under 13 112 the following factors and parameters can be taken into consideration while dealing with the anticipatory bail the nature and gravity of the accusation and the exact role of the accused must be properly comprehended before arrest is made ii the antecedents of the applicant including the fact as to whether the accused has previously undergone imprisonment on conviction by court in respect of any cognizable offence iii the possibility of the applicant to flee from justice iv the possibility of the accused likelihood to repeat similar or other offences where the accusations have been made only with the object of injuring or humiliating the applicant by arresting him or her vi impact of grant of anticipatory bail particularly in cases of large magnitude affecting very large number of people 14 vii the courts must evaluate the entire available material against the accused very carefully the court must also clearly comprehend the exact role of the accused in the case the cases in which the accused is implicated with the help of sections 34 and 149 of the penal code 1860 the court should consider with even greater care and caution because overimplication in the cases is matter of common knowledge and concern viii while considering the prayer for grant of anticipatory bail balance has to be struck between two factors namely no prejudice should be caused to the free fair and full investigation and there should be prevention of harassment humiliation and unjustified detention of the accused ix the court to consider reasonable apprehension of tampering of the witness or apprehension of threat to the complainant frivolity in prosecution should always be considered and it is only the element of genuineness that shall have to be considered in the matter of grant of bail and in the event of there being some doubt as to the 15 genuineness of the prosecution in the normal course of events the accused is entitled to an order of bail 10 on close reading of the aforesaid decision it has been enumerated that the court must evaluate the entire available material against the accused very carefully the court must also clearly comprehend the exact role of the accused in the case including the position of the accused under sections 34 and 149 of ipc and thereafter the balance has to be struck between two factors namely no prejudice should be caused to the free fair and full investigation and there should not be any harassment humiliation and unjustified detention of the accused keeping in view the said aspect let me consider the facts of the case on hand 11 it is the specific contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner accused no 6 that the petitioner is travel agent there is no incriminating material to show that he was present at the time when 16 the death of the deceased surinderpal singh took place and no specific overt act is found as against the petitioner that he has also assaulted either cws 14 15 or the deceased but it is the specific contention of the learned spp that the petitioner accused no 6 being travel agent and under the guise of sending unemployed graduates to canada he used to create fake documents and passports and used to send them to bengaluru along with other accused persons he also used to insist such persons to make calls to their parents or relatives or friends and used to extract money telling that they have already been sent to canada in that background if the charge sheet material is perused it would indicate that as per the instructions of the petitioner accused no 6 accused no 1 sent cw 14 under the guise of sending him to canada and extracted 3000 us dollors and by booking air tickets through indigo airlines in the fake name of sathinder singh he was sent to bengaluru where accused nos 15 and 16 took him and confined him 17 in house at agraharalayout kogilu accused nos 8 and 10 by showing pistol threatened him to make call to his father to give money they also assaulted him with hockey stick accused nos 9 and 14 also assaulted him with hands it is available from the charge sheet material that on 3 12 2017 accused no 1 sent cw 14 and the deceased surinderpal singh from amruthsar to mumbai airport where accused nos 6 and 13 met them and introduced themselves as naresh patel and ajaykumar dileep tiwari and respectively and took them in car bearing regn no mh 47 a4981 to hotel airport inn and made them to stay there thereafter accused nos 1 and 11 took 3000 us dollors by assuring that they will be provided visa and job at canada and paid the said amount to the petitioner accused no 6 on the same day accused no 6 informed cw 14 and the deceased that all arrangements have been made to send them to canada and they have to go to bengaluru they gave air tickets in the name of sathinder singh for 18 cw 14 and in the name of ravikumar for the deceased by telling that only to facilitate them to go to canda such fake names have been used even the charge sheet material shows that on 4 12 2017 accused nos 6 and 13 took cw 14 and the deceased to airport and by giving fake identity card and air tickets sent them to bengaluru and called accused nos 8 and 10 over the phone instructing them to take those two persons confine them in house threaten them to make call to their parents that they have reached canada and to extract the money all these materials of the charge sheet clearly go to show the active involvement of the petitioner accused no 6 in the alleged crime even it is also noticed from the charge sheet material that when accused no 10 informed accused nos 6 and 11 over phone that the deceased surinderpal singh has been resisting to make call to his parents that he has reached canada and to give money they told accused no 10 that if the deceased is left free he may file the police complaint and if he is 19 not going to pay the amount he may be dealt with dire consequences thereafter it is accused nos 2 3 8 9 10 and 14 who assaulted the deceased with iron rods and thereafter in order to screen the offence accused persons thrown the body into the bush as per the instructions of accused nos 6 10 and 11 all these materials also clearly and prima facie show the involvement of the petitioner accused no 6 in heinous crime and about the conspiracy when there is ample material to show that the petitioner accused no 6 is member of the said syndicate and he has also received the money from cw 14 then under such circumstances feel that at this juncture it is sufficient to conclude that the petitioner accused no 6 has been involved in heinous offence of human trafficking and murder which is punishable with death or imprisonment for life even it is specific contention of the learned spp that the petitioner accused no 6 has been involved in many cases as mentioned supra which are also similar in nature it 20 reflects that the petitioner accused no 6 is having bad criminal antecedents and if he is released on bail he may again indulge in such type of criminal activities he may abscond and may not be available for trial 12 even this court while considering the bail applications filed by accused nos 1 to 3 in criminal petition no 8618 2018 and connected matters disposed of on 10 4 2019 has discussed in detail all these aspects and has come to the conclusion that there is ample material as against the accused petitioners therein hence am of the considered opinion that the petitioner accused no 6 has not made out any good grounds so as to release him on bail in that light the petition is liable to be dismissed and accordingly the same stands dismissed sd judge ck '], ['

submission of the learned counsel appearing for accused no 1 petitioner in criminal petition no 8618 2018 that earlier the case was registered against unknown persons subsequently accused no 1 was

persons no recoveries have been made at his instance and no overt acts have been stated he further submitted that accused no 1 is ready to abide by any conditions imposed by this court and ready to offer sureties 5 it is the submission of the learned counsel for accused no 3 petitioner in criminal petition no 7164 2018 that the dead body of the deceased has not been identified and missing complaint was registered on 15 1 2017 in punjab and thereafter accused no 1 has been apprehended and his voluntary statement has been recorded he further submitted that there are no eye witnesses to the alleged incident and no incriminating material has been produced to connect 9 accused no 3 to the alleged crime he further submitted that no test identification parade has been conducted as

already investigation has been completed and charge sheet has been filed accused no 3 is not required for the purpose of interrogation or investigation and he is ready to abide by the conditions imposed by this court and ready to offer sureties 6 it is contended by accused no 2 petitioner in criminal petition no 726 2019 that there is no common intention or overt acts or recovery from the possession of accused no 2 or any of the incriminating material as against accused no 2 it is further contended that accused no 2 is ready to abide by the conditions imposed by this court and ready to offer sureties 10 7 on the above grounds learned counsel for the petitioners prayed to allow the petitions and to release the petitioners on bail 8 per contra the learned hcgp by substantiating the objections filed vehemently argued and submitted that accused no 1 being travel agent in furtherance of common intention contacted the deceased cws 14 and 16 and sent them to bombay and from there to bengaluru when they were taken and confined in house the passports were seized from the possession of the deceased and others and thereafter the accused persons pressurized them to make call to their relatives to give money cws 14 and 16 have given cash to the accused persons to the tune of rs 20 lakhs each the accused persons hatched plan and conspiracy to extract the money by wrongfully detaining them under the guise that they will be sent to canada she further submitted that cws 14 and 16 have identified the accused persons 11 who have kept the remaining persons in house she further submitted that accused no 1 is the kingpin who used to send the people to other accused persons and five cases are pending as against accused no 1 in all those cases the same modus operandi has been used she further submitted that thanda police have also registered case as against accused nos 1 to 3 she further submitted that the place where the accused have committed the murder of the deceased have shown the place from where stains of blood and other articles have been seized along with 108 passports she further submitted that the first charge sheet has been filed seeking liberty to file additional charge sheet still the police are investigating the case as to how many persons have been duped in the same fashion at this juncture if the petitioners are enlarged on bail they may hamper the prosecution case and they may change the direction of the investigation she further submitted that many unemployed youths have been used as victims with an 12 assurance of getting job in foreign countries human trafficking is considered to be serious offence she further submitted that the accused persons have committed the murder of the deceased by assaulting him with hockey stick rod and other articles the said offence is punishable with death or imprisonment for life the petitioners accused are the members of inter state human trafficking gangsters they are the habitual offenders by constituting syndicate and are involved in committing such offences of abduction extraction human trafficking kidnapping of unemployed youths they are having good network and they are professionally involved in such offences if they are released on bail again they may indulge in similar type of criminal activities they may abscond and they may not be available for trial and they will be menus to the society there are no good grounds made out so as to release the petitioners on bail hence she prayed to dismiss the petitions 13 9 have carefully and cautiously gone through the submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties and perused the records 10 before considering the submissions made by the learned counsel appearing for the parties want to place on record as to what are the parameters which the court has to keep in mind while considering the bail application which have been elaborately discussed by the hon ble apex court in paragraph 112 of its decision in the case of siddharam satlingappa mhetre vs state of maharashtra and others reported in 2011 1 scc 694 which read as under 112 the following factors and parameters can be taken into consideration while dealing with the anticipatory bail the nature and gravity of the accusation and the exact role of the accused must be properly comprehended before arrest is made 14 ii the antecedents of the applicant including the fact as to whether the accused has previously undergone imprisonment on conviction by court in respect of any cognizable offence iii the possibility of the applicant to flee from justice iv the possibility of the accused likelihood to repeat similar or other offences where the accusations have been made only with the object of injuring or humiliating the applicant by arresting him or her vi impact of grant of anticipatory bail particularly in cases of large magnitude affecting very large number of people vii the courts must evaluate the entire available material against the accused very carefully the court must also clearly comprehend the exact role of the accused in the case the cases in which the accused is implicated with the help of sections 34 and 149 of the penal code 1860 the court should consider with even greater care and caution 15 because overimplication in the cases is matter of common knowledge and concern viii while considering the prayer for grant of anticipatory bail balance has to be struck between two factors namely no prejudice should be caused to the free fair and full investigation and there should be prevention of harassment humiliation and unjustified detention of the accused ix the court to consider reasonable apprehension of tampering of the witness or apprehension of threat to the complainant frivolity in prosecution should always be considered and it is only the element of genuineness that shall have to be considered in the matter of grant of bail and in the event of there being some doubt as to the genuineness of the prosecution in the normal course of events the accused is entitled to an order of bail 11 on close reading of the aforesaid decision it has been enumerated that the court must evaluate the entire available material against the accused very 16 carefully the court must also clearly comprehend the exact role of the accused in the case including the position of the accused under sections 34 and 149 of ipc and thereafter the balance has to be struck between two factors namely no prejudice should be caused to the free fair and full investigation and there should not be any harassment humiliation and unjustified detention of the accused keeping in view the said aspect let me consider the facts of the case on hand 12 it is the specific case of the prosecution that accused no 1 being the travel agent under the guise of sending persons to canada used to send them to other accused persons by taking commission and in that light on 3 12 2017 he sent cw 14 and the deceased to bombay and bengaluru and thereafter confined in house it is accused nos 2 and 3 used to assault and threaten them and other persons to make phone calls to their relatives and friends to extract money by telling 17 that they have already got boarding passes to go to canada if amount is not paid then under such circumstances accused nos 2 and 3 used to assault them even the statement of the witnesses clearly goes to show that accused nos 2 3 8 9 10 and 11 used to assault with hockey stick iron rod etc in that context they have also assaulted the deceased surinderpal singh when he refused to make phone call to his relatives to give rs 20 lakhs subsequently by realizing the fact that if he is left free he may inform the police they assaulted him and ultimately caused his murder and thereafter in order to screen the evidence took the body in car and thrown into bush even while so assaulting they used to tell that they have to credit the amount to the account of accused no 1 in that light it indicates that accused no 1 has conspired with other accused persons and he is the kingpin in the said crime there was syndicate to do such crimes these acts clearly go to show the involvement of accused nos 1 2 and 3 petitioners herein 18 and other accused persons in the said crime there are specific overt acts alleged as against each of the accused persons though it is contended by the learned counsel for the petitioners that the complaint was registered against unknown persons subsequently the accused persons have been apprehended cws 14 and 16 who were also there along with the deceased and who have paid the amount and got released from the custody of the accused have identified and substantiated the case of the prosecution with reference to act of the each of the accused even the recoveries have also been done at the instance of the accused petitioners taking into consideration the material placed on record it reveals that the petitioners have been involved in human trafficking and used to collect ransom by threatening the victims by causing grievous injuries to the deceased they committed his murder the said act of the petitioners accused nos 1 to 3 appears to be serious 19 offence they have been involved in case which is punishable with death or imprisonment for life 13 from the above facts and circumstances am of the opinion that while considering the bail application the court should not only look into the fact as to whether the accused persons will be available for the purpose of trial and there is no likelihood of they being absconded but also to see the gravity of offence in which the accused have been involved and the fact that accused persons will not involve in similar type of criminal offences and the effect including the far fetching effect on the society trafficking of human beings itself is considered to be very serious offence even the said act is prohibited under the law as well as under the constitution of india it is not only the liberty of the accused which has to be looked into by this court but it has to be kept in mind whether the accused persons have intervened the other persons life and liberty by confining 20 them in confined house ill treating and harassing them now days such activities are being increased and the accused persons are taking it as profession it is submitted by the learned hcgp that five cases have already been registered as against accused no 1 and some cases have also been registered as against accused nos 2 and 3 in all those cases the accused persons have adopted the same modus operandi for extracting money by confining the human beings it appears that it is syndicate to commit such offence and it is big racket at the national and international level if such activities are not snubbed at the inception such activities will be increased and the same will become menus and big problem in the society in that light feel that these are not fit cases to grant bail to the petitioners if they are enlarged on bail they may abscond and they may not be available for trial and there may be every likelihood of they being involved in similar type of criminal activities 21 in the light of the discussion held by me above the petitioners have not made out any case so as to release them on bail hence petitions are liable to be dismissed and accordingly they are dismissed sd judge ck '], ['in the high court of

sea they instigated group of people belonging to different states and srilankan citizens to depart from india without any valid travel document it is alleged that the petitioners collected huge amount promising jobs in new zealand it is also alleged that the petitioners had the fraudulent intention of collecting huge money from the said persons 5 it has been revealed in the investigation that the bail appl nos 1476 and 1510 of 2019 6 offence under section 370 ipc is attracted in this case since the offence alleged in this case would involve the trafficking of more than one person the offence under section 370 3 ipc is prima facie attracted 6 the learned counsel for the 3rd accused has submitted that the 3rd accused is innocent and that the 3rd accused had no conspiracy at all with the other accused he had given his boat for lease and at the time of giving the boat on lease the documents from the first accused was collected and the said documents alone were seized in the house

kerala to meet his in laws the 7th accused also came to know that the parents of the 7th accused were also taken in the boat to some unknown destigation submitted by the learned counsel the 7th accused was not having any role in the matter and hence the further detention of the 7th accused is not necessary 8 it appears that various documents including passports were seized in this case the offence under bail appl nos 1476 and 1510 of 2019 8 section 370 3 ipc was incorporated only after the arrest of accused nos 2 and 10 to 15 accused nos 2 and 10 to 14 were arrested on 22 3 2019 and accused no 15 was arrested on 23 3 2019 on interrogation of the newly arrested accused it was revealed that there was human trafficking in this case submitted by the learned senior public prosecutor it appears that 70 of the amount for purchasing the boat was taken by the third accused and 30 of the amount was taken by the first accused it has been further submitted by the learned senior public prosecutor that after purchasing the boat internal arrangements were made in the boat to facilitate transportation of the passengers in the said boat it is not disputed that the boat is presently in the name of the 3rd bail appl nos 1476 and 1510 of 2019 9 accused it appears that 13500 litre of diesel was also collected in the said boat temporary toilet was also made inside the said boat 9 it is true that the petitioners have been in custody eversince their arrest on 25 1 2019 the allegations against the petitioners are grave in nature affecting the security of the nation however there are materials to connect the petitioners with the offences alleged even now the prosecution could not locate the victims it is only after locating the victims the actual purpose for which they were taken in the boat will be revealed taking persons from india to unknown destination cannot be viewed lightly the investigation bail appl nos 1476 and 1510 of 2019 10 is only at the infancy stage therefore if the petitioners are released on bail at this stage that may affect the investigation adversely considering the nature and gravity of the offences alleged against the petitioners am not inclined to

children so given this may well lead to very serious consequences such as organ trading etc the matter of the applicant differs from the purchaser considering all these facts it would not be

counteraffidavit and also placed materials collected duringthe investigation it is seen that there werefrequent calls between the petitioner and the firstaccused immediately prior to sending of the offendingmessages and making of calls by nirmala devi firstaccused to the victim girls there is prima faciematerial to show that this petitioner and a2 muruganinsisted the first accused nirmala devi to procureyoung college girls for sexual exploitation theexistence of design among the accused to commit theoffence of trafficking has also been clearly broughtout from the statement of witnesses 8 the prosecution has also placed materials beforethis court indicating that the petitioner is highlyinfluential even though he is only former scholarand is not working in the madurai kamraraj university he appears to be regular presence in the universitycampus some of the statements recorded under section161 of cr pc point to the networking abilities andwide contacts of the petitioner the witnesses inthis case hail from rural background and are all youngand innocent therefore the apprehension expressedby the prosecution that they would face dire threatsfrom the petitioner is well founded 9 this court is therefore of the view thatreleasing the petitioner on bail may even endanger thelives of the victim girls there is strong prima facieevidence to substantiate that the petitioner abettedthe commission of the grave crime of human trafficking since the number of victims is more than one thepunishment for the offence can even extend to life ofcourse in this case there was only attempt to commit the offence of trafficking as observed at the veryoutset this is case which shocked the conscience ofthe society even before the formal registration ofthe i the conversation that took place between thefirst accused nirmala devi and the college girls waswidely circulated in the social media there wasstrong agitation by political parties and studentorganizations considering the sensitive nature ofthis case investigation was transferred from the localpolice station and handed over to cb cid investigation is being headed at the level of thesuperintendent of police this would show the enormoussignificance attached to this case 10 this court is prima facie convinced that thepresent petitioner is man of considerable influence the prime witnesses are young college girls andtherefore their safety is of paramount importance letting the accused on bail would certainly prejudicefair trial witness protection is an imperative incriminal justice system therefore this court is ofthe view that this is one such exceptional case inwhich the accused will have to face the trial evenwhile being in jail of course the petitioner willhave to be afforded certain facilities so that he cangive proper instructions to his counsel in thisregard appropriate arrangements can be made onoccasion to occasion basis after obtaining directionsfrom the judicial magistrate 11 the additional

the view that balance must be struckbetween the rights and liberty of the accused and thefairness of the trial therefore this case will haveto be fast tracked the forensic lab chennai willhave to give top priority to this case this court therefore directs the forensic lab chennai to respondto the requests submitted by the investigation and makeavailable all the reports sought for within period of30

of completion of committal proceedings which was directed tobe completed on or before 24 09 2018 further it seems that thepetitioners accused 1 and 2 have misused their official position tolure the young college girls students unmindful of theirresponsibility as professors of college institution and indulgedin such grave crime for their personal benefits further there areprima facie evidence to substantiate that the accused have committedthis grave crime and if they are released there is likelihood ofendanger to the life of the victims who happen to be the poorstudents and pursuing their

the said rescue the thalaghattapura police had rescued two victim girls hailing from bangladesh and also arrested three accused persons on the spot in respect of which an fir was registered as aforestated one of the victims by name asma khatun was minor aged 17 years and another victim by name roopa roopali was aged 20 years both of them had been brought from bangladesh on the guise of getting them job as beauticians and the accused had forcibly kept them confined in brothel house and made them to indulge in prostitution in 5 order to rescue them from the clutches of the accused persons information had been given by justice and care organisation to the aht unit accordingly the aht unit led by dy sp shobha khatakwar and other officials had formed team including ngos and with their assistance went to the scene of crime along with the panch witnesses and had conducted the raid and had rescued the victims apart from arresting the accused after investigation charge sheet was laid against the accused for offences punishable under sections 370 420 366a and 366b of the ipc and under sections 3 4 5 6 7 and 9 of the immoral traffic prevention act 1956 and sections 4 8 and 17

submits that the prosecution has filed written arguments and the court below after recording the entire evidence has now set down 6 the case for arguments on the part of the defence side in the meanwhile this petition has been filed by the accused in order to dodge the proceedings for disposal in respect of offences committed by the accused in crime no 342 2014 as has been reflected in the

of providing them employment in beauty parlour at bangalore it is under misconception that these victim girls had accompanied the accused to bangalore wherein the accused persons have confined both the victims in brothel house at thalaghattapura which is reflected in the complaint in respect of which the aforestated offences were lugged against the accused in crime no 342 2014 the above case against the accused is at the fag end for disposal in the meanwhile this petition has been filed only in order to dodge the proceedings for 7 disposal on all these grounds urged by the learned hcgp for the state he seeks for dismissal of the bail petition filed by the accused he further submits that even preceding bail petitions filed by the accused came to be rejected by this court in this petition also there are no new grounds urged by the accused in order to grant the relief of bail therefore the learned hcgp seeks for dismissal of the petition filed by the accused as it is devoid of any merits for consideration of granting bail to the accused as sought for 6 as already stated there is no representation for the petitioner accused in this petition however it is relevant to state that the grounds urged in the petition by the accused no 1 petitioner reveals that the charge sheet so laid against the accused does not constitute the alleged offences against him despite of which the theory has been set up and laid charge sheet has been laid in order to harass the accused it is only on credible information got by the police that the team had been formed and raided the scene 8 of crime wherein it was alleged that the victims were brought from bangladesh by the accused for the purpose of driving them into prostitution but there is no material collected by the investigating officer during the course of investigation relating to the motive for commission of the offences this accused was apprehended by the police on 4 7 2017 and since from the date of arrest the accused is under judicial custody these grounds are urged in this bail petition apart from other grounds as urged by the accused that he is ready to abide by any terms and conditions imposed by this court while considering the bail petition filed by this accused 7 keeping in view the submission made by the learned hcgp for the state it is relevant to note that earlier bail petitions by these accused persons came to be rejected by this court in crl 5328 2015 by order dated 6 11 2015 another petition in crl 9788 2016 came to be dismissed for non compliance of the office objections by order dated 9 19 01 2017 the same finds place in the record for the purpose of perusal in crl 5328 2015 this court has expressed the view that when once the trial has commenced it would be held on day to day basis till it is completed as contemplated under section 309 cr c whereas the evidence has already been commenced and most of the witnesses have already been examined for the prosecution in order to expedite the case for disposal as contemplated under section 309 cr c the accused is required to extend his assistance for speedy disposal of the case instead of that the petitioner accused has been filing successive bail petitions without having any new circumstances for seeking the relief of bail 8 having regard to the fact that the case against the accused has reached the stage of addressing arguments on the part of the defence find no ground to consider the bail petition moreover if the accused is supposed to be granted 10 bail in this petition certainly there would be an adverse impact on the society therefore for the aforesaid reasons as well as in the peculiar circumstances of the case am of the opinion that the petitioner accused does not deserve to be released on bail

next day the husband of mai e manoj had informed the victim that it is to be his daugjter birthday he forced her to have alcohol since she had her meals but she was vomiting she was not keeping well after some time manoj had called one person the victim has given his description as fat man with black complexion he had paid some amount to manoj he had forced himself upon her sexually abused her and then ravished her thereafter he had left the house she was not keeping well but she was not taken to the hospital by manoj and since they apprehended that she would flee from their custody the applicant in criminal application no 2092 of 2017 has been identified as the man who had mhi 4 ba 2092 17 doc ravished the victim in the house of manoj and sheetal raut 5 the learned counsel for the applicant submits that the applicant was subjected to test identification parade according to the investigating agency the applicant has been identified by the victim at the test identification parade the learned counsel for the applicant submits that the test identification parade was not held in accordance with rules laid down in the criminal manual and hence the same cannot be relied upon 6 perused the memorandum of test identification parade it is true that although the applicant was aged about more than 42 years old dummies who were placed with the applicant at the test identification parade were aged about 27 20 25 etc it is commonly seen that the investigating agency do not follow the mandatory rules laid down in the criminal manual making the whole exercise of test identification parade futile exercise it is commonly seen that in most of the cases the courts are constrained to acquit person only on the ground that the test identification parade is noit held in accordance with law in any case this court cannot be oblivious of the fact that material in the form of test identification parade is only corroborative piece of evidence and identification in the court would be substantial piece of evidence but that does not mean that the mhi 5 ba 2092 17 doc investigating agency is not bound to follow the mandate of the criminal manual in case like the present one where all the accused had indulged into human trafficking by driving the girl from one place to another and selling her and pushing her into prostitution can be forgiven in fact man aged about 42 years old could easily identify that the victim was hardly 14 years old 7 the learned counsel submit that the applicant at the most would be customer the applicant was in all probabilities given an impression that the girl has volunteered to work as prostitute and therefore he cannot be blamed for the act committed by him the statement of the victim would clearly indicate that she was initially forced to have alcohol and thereafter although she resisted to the best of her capacity she was assaulted and sexually abused by the applicant in the circumstances the applicant would not be entitled to grant of bail the application of the present applicant being sans merits stands rejected criminal bail application no 2594 of 2017 8 the victim girl has given her journey from one place to

be the cousin of sheetal raut that the victim girl was taken to ahmedabad by sheetal sushila and manoj the victim girl had recognised sushila she was also residing in the close proximity of her house at sant rohidas nagar karjet sushila had taken the victim girl to her house the victim had enquird with sushila as to why she had brought her to her house the victim was made to stay in her house about 2 0 days and thereafter sushila had called upon hansaben e applicant in criminal application no 2594 of 2017 hansaben and sushila had assaulted the victim and taken her to some village she stayed there for 5 days thereafter hansaben had called upon one man called govind she had informed him that she has girl they had been moving from one place to another they met the other accused e mehul thereafter hansaben had obtained about rs 80 000 as cost for transferring the custody of the victim to govind the victim girl was assaulted by govind and caused burn injuries he had administered some medicines to her it is alleged that hansaben and sushila had thereafter taken her to village vijapur where they had obtained rs 60 000 from customer she was given into the mhi 7 ba 2092 17 doc custody of dipak who used to ravish her everyday dipak had disclosed to the victim that he had paid an amount of rs 60 000 to sushila and hansaben it is unfortunate that girl of 18 years old was made victim of human trafficking by the applicants 9 the learned counsel for the applicant submits that the only role attributed to the applicant is that she had initially given her into the custody of govind then in the custody of mehul the learned counsel submits that in fact the applicant wanted the victim to get married to mehul this could hardly be case of marriage it is clear that the victim was being sold from one place to another 10 taking into consideration the trauma the minor girl had to go through this court is of the opinion that the applicant does not deserve to be enlarged on bail the application being sans merit stands rejected 11 it is made clear that the above observations are restricted to an application under section 439 of cr c and the learned trial court shall not

record of investigation and the charge sheet 3 it is the case of the prosecution that the applicant along with other accused persons in conspiracy with each other committed an act of human trafficking of two minor children aged about 4 years and 8 years to united states of america the criminal law is set into motion by consulate general of united states of america at mumbai by sending complaint letter dated 17 05 2017 to the concerned investigating agency it is stated in the said letter that during the sneha chavan 1 3 22 aba 2251 17 doc search of their consular database revealed that an individual identifying herself as nirmala qureshi co accused had submitted visa application for her two minor children namely sara qureshi and adiv qureshi and visa was granted to them by the concerned country as per their norms the interview of the said children were not required as they were below the age of 14 years during the course of inquiry it was revealed that the visa of two children was obtained on fake documents and an apprehension was expressed by the said consulate general that in the past it was noticed by them that the human smuggling facilitators obtain fake immigration stamps so that it appears that the individuals have travelled and returned during the course of investigation other accused persons have been arrested and after completion of investigation the police have submitted charge sheet against them 4 the learned counsel for the applicant submitted that the applicant is nowhere concerned with the present crime and it is only on the basis of statement of co accused nirmala qureshi his name is reflected in the present crime he further submitted that in the present case section 370 has been wrongly applied as it is not case of human trafficking but according to him it is benevolent act committed by his client in arranging the meeting of the said two minor children with their parents in united states who had left their children in india while migrating to united states he submitted that the other accused persons have been arrested by the police and the police have already submitted sneha chavan 2 3 charge sheet and therefore his custodial interrogation at such belated stage is unwarranted he therefore prayed that the applicant may be granted pre arrest 22 aba 2251 17 doc bail 5 after completion of investigation the role of the applicant in the present crime has been crystallized and it is the prosecution case that at the instance of the co accused arif shaikh the applicant made search of two children who are having passports and are looking alike with similar features as that of two children who were transported to the united states on the basis of visa procured in the name of children of nirmala qureshi it is also the prosecution case that the applicant being passport agent has thorough knowledge about the formalities of obtaining visa it is the further prosecution case that the applicant is also passport agent and has received substantial amount from the proceeds of the crime the prosecution has categorically alleged that the accused persons hatched conspiracy in transporting smuglling the said minor children to united states the record indicates that applicant in conspiracy with co accused arif shaikh and azhar qureshi has committed the present crime 6 after taking into consideration the serious allegations against the applicant and the gravity of the offence this court is of the view that applicant does not deserve to be protected by the pre arrest bail 7 the application is accordingly

questioned pricillajabamalar and jesumanickam david and they owned up their voicein the compact disk but whereas julia uliya denied her voice 2 3 under such circumstances the central bureau

directed julia ulia and two others to give theirvoice samples aggrieved by which julia ulia is before thiscourt 3 heard mr anandapadmanaban learned counsel appearing forthe petitioner and mr ashok kumar gowtham learned specialpublic prosecutor appearing for the first respondent 4 at the outset mr anandapadmanaban learned counsel submitted that there is no provision in the code of criminalprocedure for compelling person to give the voice sample andtherefore person can refuse to give his her voice sample bytaking shelter under article 20 3 of the constitution of india he contended that the central bureau of investigation had notplaced before the trial court any material to show the manner inwhich the compact disc was obtained he also contended that it isopen to the central bureau of investigation to record thestatement under section 161 of the code of criminal procedure andthere is no necessity to obtain the voice sample of thepetitioner he further contended that the content in the compactdisc is an electronic record and in the absence of any certificateunder section 65 of the indian evidence act 1872 no reliancecan be placed upon it he further submitted that section 311 ofthe code of criminal procedure will apply only to the accused since the proviso to section 311 of the code of criminalprocedure clearly states that an order can be passed by the courtonly in respect of person who has been arrested in the case however in this case julia lulia has not even been shown as anaccused and that she was never arrested hence he submitted thatthe order passed by the trial court requires to be set aside 5 per contra mr ashok kumar gowtham learned specialpublic prosecutor placed strong reliance upon very recentjudgment of this court in kishore vs state 2017 3 mwn crl 515 and contended that the order passed by the trial courtrequires to be sustained 6 this court gave its anxious consideration to the abovesubmissions made by the learned counsel on either side 7 the question of giving voice samples has been dealt with inp kishore supra and this court is in full agreement with the lawlaid down therein in kishore case supra this court hasclearly held that an accused cannot claim any right or privilegeand refuse to give his voice sample thus when an accused himselfhas no right or privilege for avoiding to give voice sample nogreater privilege can be conferred to the petitioner who is afterall witness now the petitioner cannot be heard to say that only 4when witness graduates to become an accused and gets arrested will the police officer be permitted to obtain voice sample because in that event every unwilling witness will be in peril the power of the police officer to take voice sample of personduring investigation is traceable to the definition of the word investigation as defined in section 2 of the criminalprocedure code which reads as under investigation includes all theproceedings under this code for the collectionof evidence conducted by police officer or byany person other than magistrate who isauthorized by magistrate in this behalf 8 collecting the voice samples cannot be equated to recordingthe conversation of the accused the voice sample by itself willnot incriminate person the voice sample has to be sent alongwith the recorded conversation to the voice expert for opinion andsuch an opinion is relevant under section 45 of the indianevidence act 1872 as corroborative piece of evidence section161 of the code of criminal procedure empowers police officer torecord statement of any person and this has nothing to do withthe power of the police officer to obtain blood sample hairsample nail sample voice sample thumb impression etc if thispower to obtain such material evidences is denied to the police then section 2 cited supra would be rendered otiose andimpotent 9 as regards the submission of mr anandapadmanaban learnedcounsel that the police have not shown the place as to where fromthe compact disc was recovered in the opinion of this court thatmay not be necessary at this stage because the compact disc isnot being admitted as piece of evidence now the case is only inthe stage of investigation the question of certificate undersection 65 of the indian evidence act 1872 will come onlyduring trial and will not cover investigatory processes in fact in our jurisprudence illegally collected materials will notbecome irrelevant and inadmissible in court of law vide pooranmal vs director of inspection 1974 air 348 1974 scr 2 704 10 mr anandapadmanaban learned counsel submitted thatthere is no power in the code of criminal procedure for themagistrate to issue direction to the petitioner to give hervoice sample he further submitted that the prayer sought for bythe central bureau of investigation is for direction to thepetitioner to give her consent for giving voice sample appearsqueer to appreciate the said submission made bymr anandapadmanaban learned counsel

compel witness to give hisor her blood sample hair or nail etc 47 in sharda dharmpal supra thesupreme court has traced the power to sections75 151 and order 26 p for civilcourt for criminal court

on the point of discussion 15 conspectus of authorities referredto above would show that the principle is wellsettled that the exercise of powerunder section 311 cr c should be resorted toonly with the object of finding out the truthor obtaining proper proof of such facts whichlead to just and correct decision of thecase this being the primary duty of criminalcourt calling witness or re examining awitness already examined for the purpose offinding out the truth in order to enable thecourt to arrive at just decision of the casecannot be dubbed as filling in lacuna in theprosecution case unless the facts andcircumstances of the case make it apparent thatthe exercise of power by the court would resultin causing serious prejudice to the accusedresulting in miscarriage of justice emphasissupplied this paragraph has been affirmed bythe supreme court in rajaram prasad yadav state of bihar and another 2013 14 scc 461 51 except the high court no criminalcourt has inherent power unlike civil courtunder section 151 p however criminalcourt in order to arrive at the truth isclothed with certain incidental powers impliedpowers this has been recognized by the supremecourt in savitri govind singh rawat 1985 4 scc 337 the following passage from the saidjudgment is apposite 6 every court must be deemed topossess by necessary intendment all such powersas are necessary to make its orders effective this principle is embodied in the maxim ubialiquid conceditur conceditur et id sine quores ipsa esse non potest where anything isconceded there is conceded also anythingwithout which the thing itself cannot exist vide earl jowitt dictionary of english law 1959 ed 1797 whenever anything is requiredto be done by law and it is found impossible todo that thing unless something not authorisedin express terms be also done then thatsomething else will be supplied by necessaryintendment such construction though it may 7not always be admissible in the present casehowever would advance the object of thelegislation under consideration emphasissupplied 52 similar view has been echoedin sakiri vasu state of uttar pradesh andothers 2008 2 scc 409 in the followingparagraphs 17 in our opinion section 156 3 cr c is wide enough to include all such powers in amagistrate which are necessary for ensuring aproper investigation and it includes the powerto order registration of an fir and of orderinga proper investigation if the magistrate issatisfied that proper investigation has notbeen done or is not being done by the police section 156 3 cr c though briefly worded in our opinion is very wide and it willinclude all such incidental powers as arenecessary for ensuring proper investigation 18 it is well settled that when poweris given to an authority to do something itincludes such incidental or implied powerswhich would ensure the proper doing of thatthing in other words when any power isexpressly granted by the statute there isimpliedly included in the grant even withoutsocial mention every power and every controlthe denial of which would render the grantitself ineffective thus where an act confersjurisdiction it impliedly also grants the powerof doing all such acts or employ such means asare essentially necessary for its execution 19 the reason for the rule doctrine ofimplied power is quite apparent many mattersof minor details are omitted from legislation as crawford observes in his statutoryconstruction 3rd edn 267 if these details could not beinserted by implication the drafting oflegislation would be an interminable processand the legislative intent would likely bedefeated by most insignificant omission 20 in ascertaining necessaryimplication the court simply determines thelegislative will and makes it effective whatis necessarily implied is as much part of thestatute as if it were specifically writtentherein 853 on reading of sections91 and 311 cr c on the touchstone of theprinciple laid down in fatehsinh mohansinhchauhan case savitri case and sakirivasu case the power of criminal court tosend witness for dna profiling can be tracedto section 91 and the second limb of section311 cr c 54 the word thing employed in section91 cr c has very wide meaning and wouldtake within its fold blood samples hair nail etc of person though the literal andstrict construction of section 91 cr c maynot admit of such an interpretation yet thecode is only procedural law and procedure isonly hand maid of justice and not its master it may be apt to quote the following lines fromthe constitution bench judgment of the supremecourt in willie william slaney state ofmadhya pradesh air 1956 sc 116 the code is code of procedure and likeall procedural laws is designed to further theends of justice and not to frustrate them bythe introduction of endless technicalities 55 from conspectus of the aforesaiddiscussion this court is of the view that thesource of power for criminal court to subjecta witness and her child to dna analysis flowsfrom section 91 read with the second limbof section 311 cr c and section 45 ofthe evidence act 11 thus in the above case this court traced the source ofpower for criminal court to direct witness to give bloodsample for dna profiling to section 91 w section 311 of thecode of criminal procedure and section 45 of the indian evidenceact 1872 what applies to giving of blood sample would equallyapply to voice sample too in relation to witness why shouldjulia lulia fight shy to give her voice sample after all thecentral bureau of investigation is conducting investigation in aserious human trafficking case pursuant to the direction issuedby the division bench of this court supra unless she wants toprotect the accused or fears that her involvement in the offencewould come

charged under section 370 3 read with section 34 of the indian penal code 2 case of the prosecution as per the charges framed by the court below against the petitioners is that 1 year prior to 20 7 2015 the petitioners along with one sandeep karthiya made common intention and in furtherance of their common intention they took aghanbai bhuribai pooja barman and other villagers of village parsada police station hasaud district janjgir champa as also 2 some villagers of nearby villages of the same police station in total 22 villagers in installments without getting their names entered into the

given employment in the factory of malaysia on high wages with medical and other facilities but the villagers labourers were not made available any facility there and on their showing unwillingness to

code 3 learned counsel appearing for the petitioners argued that no case is made out against the petitioners under section 370 of the indian penal code it has not been complained by complainant aghanbai that her husband had been forcibly taken to malaysia and was bonded there to work learned counsel further argued that all the persons who had gone to malaysia were well acquainted with the first petitioner and they had gone to work there willingly the first petitioner had only made them available assistance for preparation of passport visa and other certificates documents the villagers labourers had gone to malaysia according to the contract agreement entered into between the concerned company employer and the labourers since the labourers wanted to return home early action was taken against the petitioners on the basis of the complaint made and media news the villagers labourers going to malaysia were fully aware of all the instructions and working conditions of the concerned company employer the second 3 petitioner had no role in this regard except to assist to take the villagers labourers to chennai the first petitioner himself was employed in malaysia and he assisted the villagers to go to malaysia in good faith the petitioners are neither contractors nor are they any agent of any company factory of malaysia the court below failed to appreciate the fact that the petitioners themselves had funded the entire arrangement of travel to malaysia for the villagers labourers and they had also coordinated with sandeep karthiya to get jobs for the villagers labourers the petitioners had also placed on record several materials before the court below in support of their defence including c showing that the husband of the complainant had actually no problem while working in malaysia from the statements of the witnesses recorded under section 161 of the code of criminal procedure no case is made out against the petitioners under section 370 3 of the indian penal code therefore the charges levelled against the petitioners may be set aside and they be discharged 4 per contra learned counsel appearing for the state submitted that an investigation was made by the police on the application submitted to the collector janjgir champa by the relatives of the villagers labourers who had gone to malaysia during the investigation it was found that the first petitioner along with the second petitioner and one sandeep karthiya had made common intention and in furtherance of their common intention they took villagers of village parsada police station hasaud district janjgir champa as also villagers of nearby villages of the same police station in total 22 villagers in installments without getting their names entered into the register of escapists of the gram 4 panchayat and without informing the concerned labour officer to malaysia and thereby the petitioners committed offence of human trafficking punishable under section 370 3 read with section 34 of the indian penal code after taking the villagers labourers to malaysia they were bonded forced and tortured to work there the petitioners took the villagers to malaysia by alluring them that they will be paid high wages and given medical and other facilities the first petitioner had retained with him the bank passbooks and passports of the villagers labourers the wages payable to the labourers who had gone to malaysia was being paid to their families through the first petitioner mobile phones of the labourers had also been seized by the first petitioner therefore from the documents placed on record and the statements of the witnesses recorded case under section 370 3 read with section 34 of the indian penal code is prima facie made out against the petitioners hence the instant revision preferred by them deserves to be dismissed 5 have heard learned counsel appearing for the parties at length and have perused the material available on record carefully 6 for adjudication of the issue involved in this revision it would be apt to refer to sections 227 and 228 of the code of criminal procedure which run thus 227 discharge if upon consideration of the record of the case and the documents submitted therewith and after hearing the submissions of the accused and the prosecution in this behalf the judge considers that there is not sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused he shall discharge the accused and record his reasons for so doing 5 228 framing of charge 1 if after such consideration and hearing as aforesaid the judge is of opinion that there is ground for presuming that the accused has committed an offence which is not exclusively triable by the court of session he may frame charge against the accused and by order transfer the case for trial to the chief judicial magistrate or any other judicial magistrate of the first class and direct the accused to appear before the chief judicial magistrate or as the case may be the judicial magistrate of the first class on such date as he deems fit and thereupon such magistrate shall try the offence in accordance with the procedure for the trial of warrant cases instituted on police report is exclusively triable by the court he shall frame in writing charge against the accused 2 where the judge frames any charge under clause of sub section 1 the charge shall be read and explained to the accused and the accused shall be asked whether he pleads guilty of the offence charged or claims to be tried 7 at the stage of framing of charge the court is not to see there is sufficient ground for conviction of the accused or whether the trial is sure to end in his conviction strong suspicion at the initial stage of framing of charge is sufficient to frame the charge and in that event it is not open to say that there is no sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused at the stage of framing of charge the court has to see whether the fact alleged and sought to be proved by the prosecution prima facie discloses the commission of offence on general consideration of the material placed before him by the investigating officer it is only from the available circumstantial evidence an inference of conspiracy is to be drawn at the time of framing of charge the court is not to see whether the accused would ultimately be acquitted or convicted but it is 6 the duty of the court to see whether there is any prima facie case for framing of charge 8 in state of p s johari and others air 2000 sc 665 the supreme court has held that quashment of charge by appreciating the materials produced by the prosecution at the stage of framing of charge is not justified at the stage of framing charge the trial court is not required to marshal the materials available on record but only has to prima facie consider whether there is sufficient material against the accused the supreme court held thus 4 xxx xxx xxx from the above discussion it seems well settled that at the ss 227 and 228 stage the court is required to evaluate the material and documents on record with view to finding out if the facts emerging therefrom taken at their face value disclose the existence of all the ingredients constituting the alleged offence the court may for this limited purpose sift the evidence as it cannot be expected even at the initial stage to accept all that the prosecution states as gospel truth even if it is opposed to common sense or the broad probabilities of the case 9 in niranjan singh karam singh punjabi advocate jitendra bhimraj bijjaya and others 1990 4 scc 76 the supreme court held as under 6 xxx xxx xxx that the judge while considering the 1 question of framing the charges under section 227 of the code has the undoubted power to sift and weigh the evidence for the limited purpose of finding out whether or not prima facie case against the accused has been made out where the materials placed before the court 2 disclose grave suspicion against the accused which 7 has not been properly explained the court will be fully justified in framing charge and proceeding with the trial the test to determine prima facie case 3 would naturally depend upon the facts of each case and it is difficult to lay down rule of universal application by and large however if two views are equally possible and the judge is satisfied that the evidence adduced before him while giving rise to some suspicion but not grave suspicion against the accused he will be fully within his right to discharge the accused that in exercising his jurisdiction under 4 section 227 of the code the judge which under the present code is senior and experienced judge cannot act merely as post office or mouthpiece of the prosecution but has to consider the broad probabilities of the case the total effect of the evidence and the documents produced before the court any basic infirmities appearing in the case and so on this however does not mean that the judge should make roving enquiry into the pros and cons of the matter and weigh the evidence as if he was conducting trial 10 in hem chand state of jharkhand 2008 5 scc 113 the supreme court held thus 9 it is beyond any doubt or dispute that at the stage of framing of charge the court will not weigh the evidence the stage for appreciating the evidence for the purpose of arriving at conclusion as to whether the prosecution was able to bring home the charge against the accused or not would arise only after all the evidence is brought on record the documents whereupon the at the trial appellant intended to rely were an order of assessment passed by the income tax authority and ii his declaration of assets 11 the petitioners have been charged under section 370 3 read with

human resources health police and district administration there is nothing on record to indicate the degree extent to which the state action plan has succeeded in curbing the organized crime of

dt 20 11 2014 11 rescued women and children so as to prevent their return into the black holes of the prostitution in paragraph 12 of the rejoinder petitioner asserted that state district level and other committees are wholly non functional and cannot eliminate the suffering of the victims of trafficking unless it is tackled at the grass root level which is being effectively done by the g but crippled by the inaction of police in paragraphs 14 15 of the rejoinder petitioner referred to the order of the director general of police bearing memo no 30 dated 17 06 2009 annexure whereunder anti human trafficking units were constituted and submitted that no positive action was taken by the units the respective superintendent of police failed to take swift action in professional manner against the accused trafficker the superintendent of police also did not care to maintain list of the victims and the steps taken for their rehabilitation as has been envisaged in the state plan of action astitva dated 31 12 2008 annexure feed back from the superior nodal officer of their respective jurisdiction has also not been received which is indicative of the lack luster approach of the state in the matter of human trafficking in the same paragraph petitioner further averred that in the district of araria anti human trafficking unit is not handling the cases of trafficking as per the provisions of the act thus failing in their statutory duty in rescue patna high court cwjc no 1882 of 2013 26 dt 20 11 2014 12 of the victims of uttari rampur as according to petitioner superintendent

referred to the instruction issued by g i dated 24 10 2011 addressed to all the superintendent of police of bihar enumerating the duties of ahtus and chalking out the manner in which superintendent of police should associate ahtus in anti trafficking operations in paragraph 18 of the rejoinder petitioner asserted that the police administration is still functioning in contravention of the provisions

rehabilitate the victim has not at all been mentioned in the counter affidavit counter affidavit is also silent about the establishment maintenance of shelter homes for rehabilitation of the victims and grant of legal advice counselling job training and health care facilities to them in paragraphs 23 24 25 of the rejoinder petitioner asserted about the apathetical attitude of child welfare committee araria and that of state commission for protection of child rights and pointed out that there is hardly any implementation of the act and the juvenile justice act in the patna high court

the state plan of action astitva are lacking in sensitivity as in 27 out of 38 districts of the state district level committee anti human trafficking units held its meeting after passing of order dated 01 08 2013 in the instant case in five districts meetings were held in the preceding five months and no meeting at all has been held in other six districts and thereby the authorities failed to discharge their constitutional obligation as enshrined in article 23 of the constitution in paragraph 6 of the rejoinder petitioner asserted that the officers connected with the implementation of the action plan were provided training way back in the year 2011 when the criminal law amendment act providing for new definition of human trafficking had not been inserted in the penal code as such it is absolutely expedient in the interest of justice that elaborate training programme be organized to ingrain in the mind of the special police officers as to how they are required to deal with the menace of trafficking in the light of palermo concept of trafficking and the amended law for effectively tackling the menace of human trafficking in the state which has assumed horrific proportions in paragraph 7 of the rejoinder petitioner patna high court cwjc no 1882 of 2013 26 dt 20 11 2014 14 asserted that money allocated under the social rehabilitation fund amounting to rs 95 10 lakhs is meager considering the extent and enormity of medical and financial requirement of the victims it is also stated in the same paragraph that sum of rs 12 82 lakhs was spent towards the welfare and rehabilitation of 276 victims in the same paragraph further statement has been made that in most of the districts detailed by the state in their list there is neither any victim nor disbursement in the same paragraph it is further stated that in the district of araria there has been no efforts whatsoever to rescue and rehabilitate those suffering from inter generational prostitution and young girls of the age of 12 years are being thrown into the ugly trade which is well within the knowledge of the district authorities but no action has been taken by them despite fervent appeals by the

action plan astitva originated with much enthusiasm but failed to gather momentum and fulfil the goal it sought to achieve as the home department could not gear up the requisite machinery to tackle the flourishing trafficking trade and the ahtus did not meet at necessary intervals to address itself to the purpose for which it was created and has remained an empty formality finally petitioners

provide adequate medical counselling patna high court cwjc no 1882 of 2013 26 dt 20 11 2014 19 support to the victim and the treatment meted out to them after their recovery is causal inasmuch as they

notification of the government bearing memo no 8443 dated 04 08 1997 whereunder special police officers were notified under section 13 of the act and submitted that bare perusal of the said

incident and the preparation of the panchanama before registration of the fir is bad in law in support of the argument learned counsel has referred to the orders passed by this court in p no 54250 2017 wherein this court while dealing with similar situation has referred to the decisions in crl no 7110 2011 crl no 7056 2014 crl no 9682 2016 crl no 5808 2016 p no 56504 2015 crl no 1959 2017 and

the orders relied on by the learned counsel for the petitioner the sole ground on which the petitioner herein is arrayed as the accused in the above crime is that he was present at the spot during the raid indicating that he was customer who had gone to the spot for massage the provisions of the itp act 1956 invoked by the first respondent do not get attracted to the facts alleged against the petitioner section 3 of the itp act 1956 deal with the punishment for keeping brothel or allowing premises to be used as brothel section 4 of the itp act 1956 pertains to punishment for living on the earnings of prostitution section 5 of the itp act 1956 refers to the procuring inducing or taking person for the sake of prostitution section 6 of the itp act 1956 deals about detaining person in the

provisions or any other provision of the itp act 1956 in the decisions referred above in similar fact situation the proceedings have been quashed solely on that score 6 7 the allegations made against the petitioner and the material collected against the petitioner do not show the commission of any of the offences alleged against him in the fir and the proceedings initiated against the petitioner are contrary to the decision in the case of girishchandra vs state by lokayuktha police reported in ilr 2013 karnataka 983 and the law laid down in the case of lalitha kumari vs government of p

statement of the victim recorded by the police clearly shows that the victim was an adult lady and because of her extreme poverty she had chosen to earn money in this manner her statement shows that she herself had made enquiries and had contacted the present applicant the victim herself had expressed her desire to earn money and had sought help of the present applicant the victim statement further shows how she was earning money and how the applicant was giving her fixed amount every day this statement does show that the victim on her own will and accord had indulged in these activities
